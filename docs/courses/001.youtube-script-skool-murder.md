## COLD OPEN [0:00-0:15]

[SHOW: aichrislee.com live on screen]

"This is the community platform I built in 20 hours using AI vibe coding. Zero coding experience. Just me and Claude AI.

It replaced my $99/month Skool subscription. 

[CUT TO: Claude AI interface]

And I'm about to show you the exact AI prompts and vibe coding method I used."

## THE BETRAYAL [0:15-1:30]

"Look, I need to tell you something that might piss off some people...

I fucking LOVE Sam Ovens. I love Alex Hormozi. These guys built EMPIRES on Skool.

But here's the mindfuck that broke my brain last month...

[SHOW: Sam Ovens quote about control]

Sam literally teaches us: 'Control EVERYTHING in your business.'
- Control your traffic
- Control your sales process  
- Control your fulfillment

But then... we're all paying $99/month rent for our community platform?

[DRAMATIC PAUSE]

That's when it hit me: Sam would probably respect the hell out of someone who said 'Fuck it, I'm building my own.'

Because that's what Sam would do."

## THE INVESTIGATION [1:30-3:00]

[SHOW: My actual Skool dashboard]

"So I did something crazy. I tracked every click in Skool for a week.

Here's what I ACTUALLY use:
1. Read posts
2. Comment  
3. Watch courses
4. Check calendar

That's it. Four features. 95% of my usage.

[SHOW: Skool's feature list]

But look at this shit they want me to pay for:
- Gamification points
- Leaderboards
- Badges
- 47 notification types
- XP systems
- Achievement unlocks

Are you fucking kidding me? I'm running a business, not playing Pokemon.

They have 100 features. I use 4. 

That's a 96% waste.

That's when I realized: Skool doesn't have 100 features. They have 10 features and 90 distractions."

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT AI VIBE CODING [3:00-5:00]

[SHOW: Claude AI interface]

"Let me be real with you. Everyone says 'AI makes coding easy!'

Bullshit.

[SHOW: Error messages]

Look at this. My first 10 prompts to Claude? Total garbage code.

'Build me a community platform' doesn't work. You know what works?

[SHOW: Actual working prompt]

'Create a Next.js component for a thread list showing title, author, timestamp, and reply count using shadcn/ui Card components'

Specific. Detailed. One piece at a time.

I recorded my entire messy process. Every error. Every frustration. Check it out:
[LINK ON SCREEN]

Here's what vibe coding ACTUALLY is:
- You describe one small thing
- AI builds it
- It breaks
- You fix it together
- Repeat 100 times
- Eventually... you have an app

Is it easier than traditional coding? Yes.
Is it magic? No.
Can a non-tech founder do it? Absolutely.
Will you want to quit 50 times? Also yes."

## THE 3 ERRORS THAT ALMOST KILLED ME [5:00-8:00]

### Error #1: The Database Disaster [5:00-6:00]

[SHOW: Supabase error message]

"Hour 8. My database schema was completely broken. Threads weren't linking to users.

I'm sitting there at 2 AM, manually writing SQL queries like it's 2010.

Then I discovered MCP - Model Context Protocol. It lets AI directly control your database.

[SHOW: Installing Supabase MCP]

Watch this magic...

'Hey Claude, you have access to my Supabase. Fix the thread-user relationship.'

[SHOW: Claude fixing it automatically]

Done. AI didn't just tell me what to do. It DID it.

**Lesson**: Stop copy-pasting between AI and your tools. MCP lets AI drive. You just supervise."

### Error #2: The Stripe Payment Nightmare [6:00-7:00]

[SHOW: Stripe webhook error]

"Hour 14. Every time someone tries to pay, Stripe throws an error.

Can't charge money = can't make money = why am I even building this?

[SHOW: Error logs]

The error message? 'Webhook signature verification failed.'

I'm copying webhook endpoints, secret keys, API keys... nothing works.

Then Claude spots it: 'Your webhook endpoint has a trailing slash. Stripe's doesn't.'

One. Fucking. Slash.

[SHOW: Removing the slash, payment working]

**Lesson**: With payments, every character matters. Test with real money before you celebrate."

### Error #3: The Feature Creep Catastrophe [7:00-8:00]

[SHOW: Console errors everywhere]

"Hour 19. I kept adding features. Dark mode. Analytics. Email notifications. 

My code became spaghetti. Old files mixed with new. Nothing worked.

[SHOW: File structure mess]

Look at this disaster. v1_threads.js, threads_new.js, threads_final.js, threads_FINAL_FINAL.js

The site wouldn't even load. 500 errors everywhere.

[SHOW: Git status with 47 modified files]

Solution? I used Git to go back 3 hours. Deleted all the 'nice to have' bullshit.

Shipped only what matters. The 20% that users actually need.

**Lesson**: Feature creep kills more projects than lack of features. Ship the core. Add later."

## THE EXECUTION [8:00-9:30]

[SHOW: Side-by-side comparison]

"Let me show you what I built vs what Skool offers:

**SKOOL:**
- $99/month forever
- Can't customize landing page
- No free tier
- Gamification you don't want
- Features you'll never use

**AICHRISLEE.COM:**
- $0
- REAL landing page with video
- Free tier for lead capture
- Only features that matter
- Add anything in hours

[SHOW: Live demo of aichrislee.com]

Look at this landing page. Skool gives you a pathetic text-only about page. This converts 3x better.

Look at the threads. Clean. No badges. No points. Just conversation.

Look at the courses. Same functionality. Zero bloat.

And the best part?"

[SHOW: Me in the code]

"Need a new feature? I just add it. 

Last week a member asked for CSV export. Skool doesn't have it.

[Show adding the feature]

15 minutes. Done. 

Try asking Skool for that. They'll add it to their 'roadmap' that hasn't moved since 2021."

## THE NUMBERS [9:30-10:00]

[SHOW: Calculator on screen]

"Let's talk ROI because I'm a businessman:

**SKOOL**: $99/month × 12 months × Forever = Infinite cost, zero ownership

**MY BUILD**: 20 hours × Once = Infinite ownership, infinite control

But here's what nobody talks about...

[SHOW: My SaaS expenses]

I was bleeding $10,000/month to SaaS companies. 

$120,000/year. Renting digital tools.

That's not the cost of doing business. That's the cost of being lazy."

## THE BLOODBATH [10:00-10:30]

[SHOW: Canceling Skool subscription live]

"And now... the moment you've been waiting for.

[Click cancel]

'Are you sure you want to cancel?'

Yes.

'Tell us why you're leaving?'

[Type: 'I built my own.']

[Show confirmation email]

Dead. 

$99/month saved forever. Another SaaS bites the dust."

## MY SAAS HIT LIST [10:30-11:30]

"Now that I know vibe coding works, here's what I'm planning to murder next:

[SHOW: My actual SaaS expenses]

- ConvertKit - $290/month ☠️ (next week)
- Kajabi - $199/month ☠️ (week after)
- ClickFunnels - $297/month ☠️ (pure evil)
- Zapier - $599/month ☠️ (the final boss)

That's $16,620/year I'm about to reclaim.

Each one will die in under 20 hours using AI vibe coding.

And I'm documenting every single build."

## JOIN THE REVOLUTION [11:30-END]

"Here's the deal.

I'm not a coder. I'm a marketer who discovered AI can build anything if you know how to talk to it.

[SHOW: aichrislee.com]

Every week, I pick a new SaaS to execute. You watch me build the replacement live.

No theory. No fluff. Just real builds, real errors, real solutions.

This week: Skool ☠️
Next week: ConvertKit ☠️
Week after: Your most hated SaaS ☠️

[SHOW: Course preview]

First module free. See if you can handle the truth about vibe coding.

Because once you build your first app with AI... you'll never pay for software again.

I'm AI Chris Lee.

And the SaaS genocide? It's just beginning."
