# Control OS

"I build micro SaaS that I **control**, not rent.

Every week, I pick a tool that's controlling my business and build my own version.

**23 tools built. 23 pieces of my business I now own.**"

## From Zero to $600K revenue.

"I'm Chris Lee. I dropped out of design school in Korea and started **a web agency with just a laptop**.

Grew it to 9 employees, 40K YouTube subscribers.

Then SaaS companies **broke** me."

## The Day They Said No

"They **denied** my feature requests.

**Hit API limits** during launches.

**Doubled prices** overnight.

I realized I didn't own my businessâ€”I was **renting** it.

**MY** customer data... stuck in **THEIR** computers.

**MY** business... limited by **THEIR** rules.

I was a **hostage**, not an owner."

## Taking Back Control

"So I moved to Vancouver to start fresh.

Now I build my own micro SaaS using AI instead of renting from others.

Circle.so wouldn't let me customize profiles. **Built my own in 20 hours.**

ConvertKit had a 25 automation limit. **Built unlimited in 15 hours.**

Calendly couldn't handle my scheduling. **Built exactly what I needed in 12 hours.**

The problem was never money. It was **control**."

---

## Join the Movement

"I'm documenting this journey on YouTube.

I share not only how I build each tool but the **mistakes I make** and **walls I hit**.

In Control OS, you get:

My exact **20-hour build process**

Every **template** I've created

**Live Saturday sessions** where we build together

A **community** of people taking back control

By no means am I claiming to have all the answers. **I'm still figuring things out as I go along.**"

## Your Business, Your Rules

"This isn't about being a developer.

It's about **owning** your business instead of **renting** it.

Join me every week as I take back control, one tool at a time.

**Control OS. $97/month.**

Let's build what we need."
