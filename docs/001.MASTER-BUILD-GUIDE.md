# The Conversational Build Guide: How to Get AI to Build Your $97/month Platform

> "Here's the secret nobody tells you: building with AI isn't about knowing code - it's about knowing how to ask. I built a $300K/year platform by having the right conversations with Claude. This guide shows you exactly how to do the same."

## ðŸŽ¯ The Big Idea

Okay, so check this out. Instead of teaching you SQL queries and React components, I'm gonna teach you something way more powerful - how to have conversations with AI that actually get shit built.

You know why most people fail with AI coding? They try to micromanage it. They paste in tutorials, they give vague instructions, they don't know how to ask for what they want. But here's the thing - Claude (or any AI) can build literally anything if you know how to talk to it.

**What we're building**: A membership platform that charges $97/month teaching entrepreneurs to productize themselves
**How we're building it**: Through strategic conversations with AI, not by learning to code
**The result**: Same platform, 10x faster build time, zero coding knowledge required

---

# Phase 1: The Foundation Conversation

*Before you write a single line of code, you need Claude to understand exactly what you're building. These 3 master prompts will clarify everything.*

## Master Prompt #1: Define Your Vision

```
I want to build a membership platform. Here's my vision:

â€¢ The Big Idea: [Your one-sentence concept]
â€¢ Target Audience: [Who pays you money]
â€¢ The Promise: [What transformation you deliver]
â€¢ Pricing: $[X]/month
â€¢ Core Features: 
  - Landing page with email capture
  - Payment processing
  - Member content area
  - [Your unique feature]

Before we start building, what questions do you have about my concept?
```

**Example filled in:**
"The Big Idea: Teach entrepreneurs to build AI tools that automate their business"
"Target Audience: Solopreneurs making $5-50k/month who waste time on repetitive tasks"
"The Promise: Build your first automation tool in 14 days"

## Master Prompt #2: Validate and Simplify

```
I validated my idea by [what you did]. Here's what I learned:
â€¢ [Key insight 1]
â€¢ [Key insight 2]
â€¢ [X]% of people said they'd pay $[price]

My constraints:
â€¢ Budget: $[amount] 
â€¢ Timeline: [X weeks]
â€¢ My skills: [honest assessment]

What's the absolute simplest version that can take payments and deliver value?
```

## Master Prompt #3: Pick Your Tools

```
Based on our plan, what tech stack should we use?

Requirements:
â€¢ Zero coding knowledge needed
â€¢ Free or cheap to start
â€¢ Can handle 100 paying users
â€¢ Won't break when I update things

Explain each choice in one sentence.
```

**ðŸ”¥ The #1 Rule**: Be specific about outcomes, not features. Claude builds what you describe, so describe the result you want, not the technology.



## Master Prompt #4: Set Everything Up

```
I'm ready to start building. I'm on [Mac/Windows/Linux].

Walk me through:
1. Creating the project
2. Installing necessary tools
3. Setting up the database
4. Connecting everything

For each step:
â€¢ Give me the exact command to type
â€¢ Tell me what success looks like
â€¢ Tell me how to fix common errors

Treat me like I've never seen code before.
```

**Follow up after each step**: "I typed [command] and got [result]. Is this correct?"

---

# Phase 2: The Design Conversation

*Professional design without being a designer. These 3 prompts are all you need.*

## Master Prompt #1: Create Your Design System

```
I need a simple design for my [$97/month membership platform about X].

Requirements:
â€¢ Professional like [Stripe/Notion/Linear]
â€¢ Works on phones and laptops
â€¢ Easy for non-designers to implement

Give me:
1. 3-4 colors (with exact values)
2. Font sizes for headings/body/buttons
3. Spacing system (margins/padding)
4. Examples from sites I can reference

Keep it simple enough that I can't mess it up.
```

## Master Prompt #2: Build Your Landing Page

```
I need a high-converting landing page structure.

My offer: [Your $97/month membership]
My audience: [Target customer]
My promise: [Main benefit]

Create:
1. Headline options (under 10 words)
2. Section order (hero, benefits, pricing, etc)
3. What goes in each section
4. The ONE call-to-action to use

Base it on what works for successful membership sites.
```

## Master Prompt #3: Design Your App Layout  

```
I need a simple layout for logged-in members.

They need to access:
â€¢ [Content area]
â€¢ [Community feature]
â€¢ [Account settings]
â€¢ [Your unique feature]

Show me:
1. Navigation structure (mobile + desktop)
2. Page layouts for each section
3. How members flow between features

Use patterns from [Skool/Circle/Discord] but simpler.
```

# Phase 3: The Database & Backend Conversation

*Setting up where your data lives and making buttons actually work. Just 4 master prompts.*

## Master Prompt #1: Set Up Your Database

```
I need a database for my membership platform using Supabase.

What we're storing:
â€¢ User accounts and profiles
â€¢ Payment/subscription status  
â€¢ [Your content type]
â€¢ [Your community feature]

Give me:
1. Exact steps to set up Supabase
2. The minimum tables needed
3. Security settings to enable
4. How to test it's working

Explain it like I've never seen a database.
```

## Master Prompt #2: Connect Stripe Payments

```
I need to accept $[97]/month subscriptions using Stripe.

Requirements:
â€¢ Recurring monthly payments
â€¢ Free trial period of [X days] (optional)
â€¢ Cancel anytime
â€¢ Automatic access on payment

Walk me through:
1. Setting up Stripe
2. Creating the subscription product
3. Connecting to my app
4. Testing with fake cards

Include what usually goes wrong and how to fix it.
```

## Master Prompt #3: Build Your APIs

```
Make these features actually work:

1. User signup/login
2. Subscribe button â†’ Stripe checkout
3. [Your main feature]
4. [Your community feature]

For each feature:
â€¢ Show me the exact code
â€¢ Tell me where it goes
â€¢ How to test it works
â€¢ Common errors and fixes

I don't understand backend code, so be extra clear.
```

## Master Prompt #4: Secure Everything

```
I'm about to launch with real users and payments. Make sure I'm secure:

1. Check my database permissions
2. Verify payment webhooks work
3. Test user data is protected
4. Find any security holes

Give me:
â€¢ A security checklist
â€¢ Exact tests to run
â€¢ How to fix any issues
â€¢ What could go wrong if I skip this

Be paranoid - I'd rather be too secure than hacked.
```

# Phase 4: Launch & Polish Conversation

*Making it smooth, testing everything, and going live. These final prompts get you to launch.*

## Master Prompt #1: Polish The Experience

```
My app works but feels rough. Make it professional:

1. Add loading states (so users know things are happening)
2. Add error messages (that actually help)
3. Make it mobile-friendly
4. Speed up slow parts

For each improvement:
â€¢ Show me what to add/change
â€¢ Where it goes in the code
â€¢ How to test it worked

Focus on what paying customers will notice most.
```

## Master Prompt #2: Test Everything

```
I need to test before launching. Walk me through:

1. Create a test account
2. Make a test payment
3. Access paid features
4. Test on mobile
5. Test what happens when things fail

Give me:
â€¢ Exact click-by-click steps
â€¢ What should happen at each step
â€¢ How to fix common issues
â€¢ A checklist to run before launch
```

## Master Prompt #3: Deploy to Production

```
I'm ready to go live. Using [Vercel/your platform]:

1. Deploy my code
2. Set up my custom domain (optional)
3. Configure all production settings
4. Switch Stripe to live mode
5. Do a final security check

Give me:
â€¢ Step-by-step deployment guide
â€¢ Settings I must not forget
â€¢ How to test it's live

This is my first launch - assume I know nothing.
```

## Master Prompt #4: The Day 1 Operations

```
I just launched! Help me prepare for real users:

1. Monitor for errors
2. Track signups and payments
3. Handle support questions
4. Fix urgent bugs

Create:
â€¢ A daily checklist
â€¢ Where to look for problems
