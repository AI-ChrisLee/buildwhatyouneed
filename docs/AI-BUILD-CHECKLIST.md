# AI-Powered Build Checklist: The 4-Step Control Blueprint

> Build What You Need. Own Everything. Using AI.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
1. **Don't Overbuild**: MVP in 20 hours. Period.
2. **Copy Shamelessly**: Use their UI as inspiration
3. **Focus on YOUR Needs**: Build what YOU need, not what everyone needs
4. **Use AI Aggressively**: Let Claude/GPT write 80% of code
5. **Ship Daily**: Deploy every day, even if broken
6. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank you
7. **Share Progress**: Build in public for accountability

**Remember**: The goal isn't to build perfect software. It's to own your tools, control your data, and stop being held hostage by SaaS companies.

**You don't need permission. You need 20 hours and this checklist.**
