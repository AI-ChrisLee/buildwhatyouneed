- ✅ Password requirements (8+ characters)

### Verified
- No critical vulnerabilities (npm audit)

## Recommendations

### Before Launch
1. Re-enable leads RLS with service role key
2. Test with real Stripe live keys
3. Complete mobile responsiveness testing
4. Run accessibility audit
5. Test cross-browser compatibility

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor rate limit effectiveness
2. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
3. Configure uptime monitoring
4. Regular security updates
