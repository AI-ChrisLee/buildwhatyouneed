## The Hook Section

### The Problem (Their Current Reality)
**You're stuck in the SaaS trap:**
- Paying $500/month for tools that "almost" work
- Waiting months for features you need today
- Explaining your vision to developers who don't get it
- Trading time for money instead of building systems

### The Revelation
**I discovered something:** With AI, I can build in 20 hours what SaaS companies charge $500/month for.

**The kicker:** I'm not a developer. I'm just an entrepreneur who got tired of renting everyone else's vision.

## About Section

### My Story (Keep It Real)
Built a $600K agency in Korea. 9 employees. 40K YouTube subscribers. 

Looked successful on paper. Felt stuck in reality.

Then I went monk mode with AI. Started building instead of buying. Now I own every tool in my business.

**My mission:** Become a trillion-dollar entrepreneur. Not by raising money. By systematizing everything.

### The Challenge That Started It All
**1 week, 1 app.** Not because I had to. Because it proved I could.

Week 1: Built my own community platform (bye Circle.so)
Week 2: Customer intelligence system (10 hrs/week → 30 min)
Week 3: Content engine (2 hrs/day → 5 min)
Week 52: Entire business automated

- Build for myself first

**Phase 2: EDUCATE**
- Document every error (saved you 6 hours on Error #23)
- Transform chaos into step-by-step process
- Create templates from working code
- Real struggles, real solutions

**Phase 3: SHARE**
- Weekly YouTube videos, same format
- Show the problem, the process, the reality
- Raw footage - errors included
- "Get the code in the community"

**Phase 4: ANALYZE**

## The Philosophy Section

### Core Principles

**Build Only What You Need**
No feature bloat. If you're not using it this week, don't build it.

**Clone First, Customize Second**
Start with what works. Make it yours. Don't reinvent.

**Show Everything**
The bugs, the frustrations, the breakthroughs. Truth builds trust.

**ROI or Die**
If it doesn't save time or make money, we don't build it.

## The Revolution Section

### Welcome to the Age of the Builder-Entrepreneur

**Before AI:** Only developers could build. You had to rent or hire.

**After AI:** Every entrepreneur can build. You own everything.

**The future belongs to builders.** Not managers. Not coordinators. Builders.

And with AI, we can all be builders now.

## FAQ Section

A: First build: 20 hours. By build #10: 5-8 hours. It gets easier fast.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: That's what the community is for. We've documented every error.

**Q: Is this just another coding course?**
A: No. This is me building tools for MY business and showing you exactly how.

A: Whatever annoyed you most this week. Start there.

### The Bottom Line

I build a new tool every week. You can watch for free or build alongside me for $97/month.

Either way, the revolution has started.

**The question isn't "Can I build this?"**
**It's "What should I build first?"**

Let's figure that out together.
