# Security Audit Results

**Date**: 2025-07-04
**Phase**: 7 - Pre-Launch Testing & Optimization

## Summary

Completed comprehensive security audit with automated scanning and manual fixes.

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **Next.js Vulnerability**
   - Updated Next.js from 14.2.3 to 14.2.30
   - Fixed critical DoS and authorization bypass vulnerabilities
   - Status: RESOLVED

2. **Security Headers**
   - Added X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
   - Added X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
   - Added Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
   - Added Content-Security-Policy (allows Stripe, blocks unsafe scripts)
   - Status: RESOLVED

3. **XSS Protection**
   - Replaced unsafe markdown rendering with marked + DOMPurify
   - Sanitizes all user-generated content
   - Whitelist allowed HTML tags and attributes
   - Status: RESOLVED

4. **Input Validation**
   - Implemented Zod schemas for all user inputs
   - Email validation with proper format checking
   - Password minimum length enforcement (8 chars)
   - Content length limits to prevent DoS
   - Status: RESOLVED

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
   - API endpoints: 60 requests per minute
   - Prevents brute force attacks
   - Status: RESOLVED

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication Security
- Password minimum 8 characters
- Email verification available (optional)
- Session-based authentication with Supabase
- Rate limiting on login/signup endpoints

### 2. Data Validation
- All user inputs validated with Zod
- SQL injection prevented by Supabase parameterized queries
- XSS prevented by DOMPurify sanitization
- Content length limits on all text fields

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforced (handled by Vercel)
- Security headers configured
- Environment variables properly secured
- No hardcoded secrets in production code

### 4. Supabase Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Policies restrict data access by user
- Service role key not exposed to client
- Webhook secrets properly configured

## Remaining Considerations

### Manual Checks Required
1. Verify RLS policies are properly restrictive
2. Ensure email verification is enabled if needed
3. Review Stripe webhook endpoint security
4. Monitor rate limit effectiveness

### Production Deployment
1. Use production Stripe keys (not test keys)
2. Configure proper domain in CSP headers
3. Set up monitoring for security events
4. Regular security updates for dependencies

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Run `npm audit` weekly
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed login attempts
3. **Backup**: Regular database backups
4. **Testing**: Penetration testing before major releases
5. **Documentation**: Keep security procedures documented

## Compliance

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed
- GDPR compliance through data minimization
- PCI compliance delegated to Stripe
- Security headers follow best practices

## Next Steps

1. Complete user journey testing
2. Mobile responsiveness testing
3. Cross-browser compatibility
4. Accessibility audit
5. Performance optimization
