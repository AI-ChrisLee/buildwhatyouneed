# Skool Clone Course: The 4 Step Vibe Blueprint

## Step 1: TARGET - Know Your Enemy
**Module 1: The Awakening**
I love Sam Ovens and Alex Hormozi, they built amazing communities on Skool. But if I have the power to build my own platform with AI, why wouldn't I control my own destiny?

**Module 2: The 80/20 Analysis**
List what you actually use: threads, courses, members, admin panel. Ignore their 90% bloat features like gamification and complicated analytics.

## Step 2: CLONE - Build with AI
**Module 3: Wireframe (Day 1-2)**
Sketch the UI - landing page, threads, courses, member areas. Function over form, just get the structure right and let shadcn make it pretty.

**Module 4: Database (Day 3-4)**
Design your schema in Supabase - users, threads, courses, lessons. Set up the relationships and security rules so members can only see their own data.

**Module 5: Backend (Day 5-8)**
Build the APIs, authentication, and core functionality. Connect Stripe for payments and make all the buttons actually work.

**Module 6: Polishing (Day 9-10)**
Add loading states, error handling, mobile optimization, dark mode. Make it feel expensive even though you built it in 10 days.

## Step 3: IMPROVE - Add Your Features
**Module 7: The Landing Page Revenge (Day 11-12)**
Skool gives you a plain text about page - that's it. We're building a full landing page with video, testimonials, pricing, everything you need to convert visitors into members.

**Module 8: More Power Features (Day 13)**
Add free tier (Skool doesn't have), dark mode, unlimited courses, API access. These are the features that make YOUR platform more powerful than theirs.

## Step 4: LIBERATE - Export & Cancel
**Module 9: Launch & Celebrate (Day 14)**
Deploy to Vercel, connect your domain, go live with real payments. Share your creation with the world and inspire others to build their own.

**Module 10: Next Target - GoHighLevel CRM**
Now that you control your community, let's add CRM features to track customers and automate like GoHighLevel. This is how we compound our power - each tool we build makes the next one stronger.

**The Result:** In 14 days, you'll own a community platform that does everything Skool does, plus features they refused to build. No more monthly ransom. Just pure control in your backyard.

*Each module includes master prompts, error solutions, and live demos of me building this exact platform.*
