# The AI Conversation Masterclass: Build Your Community Platform in 6 Steps

> "Look, I'm not gonna teach you to code. I'm gonna teach you something better - how to have conversations with AI that get shit done. I built this exact platform we're using right now, and I did it by talking to Claude. Here's exactly how."

## What This Really Is

Alright, let's cut the BS. You know how every coding course gives you 47 hours of videos about variables and functions? Yeah, we're not doing that.

Here's the deal: I built a **$300K/year membership platform** by having the right conversations with AI. Not by memorizing syntax. Not by understanding algorithms. Just by knowing what to ask and when to ask it.

**üéØ The 6-Step Framework**:
1. **Foundation** - Get crystal clear on WHAT you're building
2. **UI Wireframe** - Make it look good (without being a designer)
3. **Database** - Set up where your data lives
4. **Backend** - Make the buttons actually work
5. **Polishing** - Fix the rough edges
6. **Launch** - Go live and get paid

That's it. Six conversations. Each one builds on the last. By the end, you'll have a working platform charging $97/month.

**üõ†Ô∏è Our Fixed Tech Stack** (Everyone uses the same):
- **Cursor + Claude Code** - Your AI coding environment
- **Next.js** - The framework that just works
- **Supabase** - Database + Authentication
- **Vercel** - Hosting that scales
- **Git** - Version control
- **Stripe** - Payments that convert

---

# Step 1: Foundation (The Most Important Conversation)

Look, 90% of people fuck this up. They jump straight into "make me a landing page" without telling AI what they're actually building. That's like getting in an Uber and saying "drive" without giving an address.

## üéØ The Plan Mode Strategy

**First, you activate Claude's plan mode**. This is where the magic happens - Claude thinks through everything BEFORE writing a single line of code.

### The Initial Conversation

```
I want to build a membership community platform. Here's my initial plan:

THE BUSINESS:
‚Ä¢ Teaching entrepreneurs to build AI tools that automate their business
‚Ä¢ Target: Solopreneurs making $5-50k/month
‚Ä¢ Price: $97/month membership

THE FEATURES:
‚Ä¢ Landing page with video + email capture
‚Ä¢ Stripe payments
‚Ä¢ Member area with courses
‚Ä¢ Community threads/discussions

Before we dive deeper, what questions do you have to help clarify and simplify this plan?
```

### What Claude Will Ask (And Your Answers)

Claude will probe deeper. Here's a real example from building our platform:

**Claude**: "What specific transformation are you promising members?"
**You**: "They'll build their first automation tool in 14 days that saves them 10+ hours/week"

**Claude**: "What makes your approach different from other AI courses?"
**You**: "I teach conversations, not code. Plus I share my actual tools I use in my business"

**Claude**: "What's the minimum viable version to validate this?"
**You**: "Landing page ‚Üí Email list ‚Üí One course ‚Üí Basic forum. That's it."

Keep going until Claude says something like "I have a clear picture now."

## üí° Real Platform Example

Here's exactly how I defined THIS platform you're using:

```
THE BUSINESS:
‚Ä¢ What I'm Building: "Build What You Need" - A community teaching entrepreneurs to build their own SaaS tools using AI
‚Ä¢ Who Pays Me: Online entrepreneurs who are tired of paying for 20 different tools
‚Ä¢ Their Big Problem: They spend $2000+/month on SaaS that doesn't quite fit their needs
‚Ä¢ My Solution: Show them how to build exactly what they need in days, not months
‚Ä¢ Price Point: $97/month

THE FEATURES:
Must-haves for launch:
- Landing page with my story + video
- Email capture for free members
- Stripe subscription checkout
- Member dashboard with my weekly builds
- Community threads for questions

Nice-to-haves (added later):
- Live office hours calendar
- Template library
- AI prompt database
```

## üìã The PRD (Your Build Bible)

After that conversation, you'll ask Claude for one thing:

```
Based on our discussion, create a detailed PRD (Product Requirements Document) with:

1. Project Overview (2-3 sentences)
2. User Flow (who uses this and why)
3. Technical Architecture (keep it simple)
   - Next.js (App Router)
   - Shadcn UI components
   - Supabase (Auth + Database)
   - Stripe (Payments)
   - Vercel 
   4. Development Phases with checkpoints

For the checkpoints, break it down like this:
(Each phase should have 5-10 specific checkpoints)

Our 6 phases: 
1. Foundation - Project setup and structure
2. UI Wireframe - Design system and components
3. Database - Tables and relationships
4. Backend - APIs and business logic
5. Polishing - UX improvements
6. Launch - Deploy and go live

Example format:
FOUNDATION CHECKPOINTS:
‚ñ° Next.js project created with TypeScript
‚ñ° Shadcn UI installed and configured
‚ñ° Supabase project connected
‚ñ° Environment variables set up
‚ñ° Git repository initialized
‚ñ° Basic folder structure ready
‚ñ° [Your specific needs]

Make each checkpoint specific and testable. I should be able to check a box when it's done.
```

**‚úÖ Now you have your roadmap**. Every single thing you need to build is on that list. This becomes your North Star for the entire project.

# Step 2: UI Wireframe (Make It Not Suck)

Alright, here's where most non-designers panic. "I can't design!" Bullshit. You don't need to be a designer. You need to tell AI what you want it to look like.

## üé® The Master Design Prompt

```
I need you to design my membership platform UI. Here's the vibe:

INSPIRATION:
‚Ä¢ Make it feel like [Stripe/Linear/Notion - pick one]
‚Ä¢ Clean, professional, trustworthy
‚Ä¢ Works perfectly on phone and desktop

BRAND:
‚Ä¢ Main color: [Pick one - blue for trust, green for growth, etc]
‚Ä¢ Feel: [Professional/Playful/Minimal]
‚Ä¢ Similar to: [Site you like]

Now create:
1. A complete design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
2. Landing page structure (what goes where)
3. Member dashboard layout
4. Mobile-first approach

For each design decision, tell me WHY it works for my audience.

```

## üíª The "Show Me" Follow-up

After Claude gives you the design, hit it with:

```
Cool. Now show me EXACTLY how to implement this:
1. What Tailwind classes to use
2. The exact component structure  
3. How to make it responsive
4. Common mistakes to avoid

Remember, I've never done this before. Be specific.
```

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint Implementation

```
Now implement the UI WIREFRAME checkpoints from my PRD.
```

That's it. Claude already knows your checkpoints from Step 1. Just reference them.


---

# Step 3: Database (Where Your Shit Lives)

This is where people usually freeze up. "Database? That sounds complicated!" Nah. It's just spreadsheets with superpowers.

## üóÑÔ∏è The Master Database Prompt

```
Time to set up my database with Supabase. Here's what I need to store:

USER DATA:
‚Ä¢ User accounts (email, password)
‚Ä¢ Profile info (name, avatar)
‚Ä¢ Subscription status (free/paid)

MY CONTENT:
‚Ä¢ [Your content type - courses, posts, etc]
‚Ä¢ [Relationships between content]

Walk me through:
1. Setting up Supabase (step by step)
2. Creating the exact tables I need
3. Security rules (so people can't steal data)
4. How to test it's working

Assume I know nothing about databases. ELI5 everything.
```

## üîí The Security Check

**ALWAYS** follow up with:

```
Now let's make sure this is secure:
1. Check my Row Level Security policies
2. Verify payment data is protected  
3. Test that users can only see their own data
4. Show me how to test each security rule

What could go wrong if I skip this?
```

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint Implementation

```
Now implement the DATABASE checkpoints from my PRD.
```

---

# Step 4: Backend (Make Buttons Do Things)

This is where the magic happens. Those pretty buttons need to actually work.

## ‚ö° The Master Backend Prompt

```
Let's make my platform functional. Connect everything:

AUTHENTICATION:
‚Ä¢ Sign up with email
‚Ä¢ Login/logout
‚Ä¢ Password reset
‚Ä¢ Protected member areas

PAYMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Stripe checkout for $97/month
‚Ä¢ Webhook to update user status
‚Ä¢ Cancel subscription flow

MY FEATURES:
‚Ä¢ [Your feature 1 - be specific]
‚Ä¢ [Your feature 2 - be specific]

For each piece:
1. Show me the exact code
2. Tell me which file it goes in
3. How to test it works
4. What errors I might see

I don't understand backend code, so explain what each part does.
```

## üí≥ The Integration Reality Check

```
I need to connect Stripe. Walk me through:
1. Creating a Stripe account
2. Getting API keys  
3. Setting up the product ($97/month)
4. Testing with fake credit cards
5. Common errors and how to fix them

What usually breaks here and how do I fix it?
```

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint Implementation

```
Now implement the BACKEND checkpoints from my PRD.
```

---

# Step 5: Polishing (Make It Smooth)

Your platform works, but it probably feels janky. Time to fix that.

## ‚ú® The Master Polish Prompt

```
My platform works but needs polish. Fix these issues:

USER EXPERIENCE:
‚Ä¢ Add loading states (so people know stuff is happening)
‚Ä¢ Error messages that actually help
‚Ä¢ Success messages when things work
‚Ä¢ Smooth transitions between pages

PERFORMANCE:
‚Ä¢ Make it fast (what's slowing it down?)
‚Ä¢ Optimize images
‚Ä¢ Cache what matters

MOBILE:
‚Ä¢ Test every feature on phone
‚Ä¢ Fix anything that looks broken
‚Ä¢ Make buttons finger-friendly

For each fix, show me:
1. The problem
2. The solution code
3. Where to put it
4. How to test it worked
```

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint Implementation

```
Now implement the POLISHING checkpoints from my PRD.
```

---

# Step 6: Launch (Get Paid)

You built it. Now let's get it live and making money.

## üöÄ The Master Launch Prompt

```
Ready to launch. Using Vercel, walk me through:

DEPLOYMENT:
1. Connect my GitHub
2. Deploy to production
3. Set up environment variables
4. Custom domain (optional)

GO LIVE:
1. Switch Stripe to live mode
2. Test a real payment
3. Verify webhooks work
4. Check email notifications

LAUNCH CHECKLIST:
Create a final checklist covering:
- Security checks
- Payment flow
- Mobile testing  
- SEO basics
- Analytics setup

What typically breaks on launch day?
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checkpoint Implementation

```
Now implement the LAUNCH checkpoints from my PRD.
```

---

# üí™ The Reality Check

Look, here's what nobody tells you about building with AI:

**It's not perfect the first time**. You'll hit errors. Shit won't work. That's normal.

The difference? When you hit an error, you just paste it back to Claude: *"I got this error: [error]. How do I fix it?"*

That's it. No Stack Overflow. No debugging for hours. Just paste, get answer, fix, move on.

## üéØ My Promise to You

If you follow these 6 steps - have these exact conversations with Claude - you'll have a working platform. Will it be perfect? No. Will it make money? If you picked the right audience and problem, **absolutely**.

The best part? Once you build one, you can build anything. Because you'll understand the pattern:
1. **Be specific** about what you want
2. **Ask AI the right questions**  
3. **Test everything**
4. **Fix what breaks**
5. **Ship it**

## üî• Your Next Move

Stop watching tutorials. Stop reading documentation. **Start having conversations with AI**.

Your first prompt? Use my Foundation prompt above. Fill in your details. See what Claude says.

Then build the damn thing.

Because every day you're not building is another day you're paying someone else for tools you could own.

## üí° The Secret Sauce

Here's what makes this different from every other course:

**Traditional courses**: Learn syntax ‚Üí Build toy projects ‚Üí Maybe ship someday
**This approach**: Define business ‚Üí Have conversations ‚Üí Ship in a week

You don't need to understand how React works. You need to understand how to **describe what you want** to AI.

## üéä Final Motivation

I was exactly where you are. Paying for 20 different SaaS tools. Wanting to build my own stuff but thinking "I'm not a developer."

Then I realized: **AI changed the game**. Now anyone who can clearly explain what they want can build it.

In one week, you'll have:
- Your own platform
- Your first paying customer
- The confidence to build anything

All from having the right conversations.

---

*Remember: I built this exact platform you're reading this on by having these conversations. No coding background. No technical degree. Just clarity on what I wanted and the right prompts to get there.*

**Now stop reading and start building. Your first $97/month customer is waiting.**

üöÄ **See you on the other side.**
