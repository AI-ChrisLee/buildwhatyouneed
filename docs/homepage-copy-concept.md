## Welcome to Control OS

Every Sunday, I pick a tool we're sick of paying for, build a better version with AI in a week, and take back control.

Then I show you exactly how I did it. No fluff. No theory. Just raw footage of us vibe coding with AI and owning our tools.

## Why We Started Building

Chris Lee ran a $600K/year agency. 40K YouTube subscribers. 

Then SaaS companies broke him:
- Feature requests: DENIED
- API limits hit during launches  
- Prices doubled overnight

He realized: MY customer data in THEIR computers. MY business on THEIR terms.

So I quit. Moved to Vancouver. Started building micro SaaS with AI. Now we're a community of 2k+ builders taking back control.

## The 4 Step AI Control Blueprint

1. **Target**: Pick your most hated SaaS
2. **Clone**: Use AI to recreate what you need 
3. **Improve**: Add features they refused to build
4. **Own**: Export, migrate, control forever

Every week, new execution. Every week, new freedom.
