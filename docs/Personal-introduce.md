# Personal Introduction Hub - Chris Lee

## Core Identity
**I build software that I need, educate in my community, and share my journey on YouTube.**

I ran a web agency in Korea with 9 employees. Made $600K in 2 years. Got 40K YouTube subscribers. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador at line company. But I hit my limit. Webagency model is not my dream. So I quit everything and moved to Vancouver to find what I really want to do with my life. 

Now I use AI to build my own tools instead of paying for them. Every week, I pick one expensive tool, build my own version, and show you exactly how I did it.

## YouTube Description
```
I dropped out of design school in Korea and started a web agency from nothing. 

Built it up to 9 employees, $600K/year revenue, and 40K YouTube subscribers in korea sharing every win and fail. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador.

But I quit it all. Left Korea. Moved to Vancouver.

Why? Because I realized:

**MY customer data... in THEIR database.**

**MY business... behind THEIR API limits.**

**One price hike, one shutdown, and I lose everything.**

I was just renting my entire business from software companies.

So I learned to use AI to build my own tools. Now every week, I pick one overpriced software and build my own version in about 20 hours. Then I show you exactly how I did it - every error, every breakthrough, every line of code.

I'm not claiming to have all the answers. I'm still figuring things out as I go. But I'm documenting everything so you can learn with me.

This channel is about taking control of your business, one tool at a time.

## LinkedIn About Section
```
I ran a web agency in Korea. 9 employees. $600K/year. 40K YouTube subscribers.

Worked with big companies like LINE. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador. But I was spending $10,000 every month on software subscriptions. I had no control over the tools that ran my business.

So I quit everything. Sold the agency. Left Korea. Moved to Vancouver.

Now I use AI to build my own software. Every week, I pick one tool I was paying for and build my own version. Takes about 20 hours. Then I share exactly how I did it on YouTube.

I've built replacements for Circle.so, ConvertKit, Calendly, and 20+ other tools. Each one works exactly how I need it to work. No monthly fees. No waiting for features. No price increases.

I'm not special. Anyone can do this with AI. That's why I document everything - every mistake, every breakthrough, every line of code.

Currently living in Vancouver, building software, and sharing the journey.

## Networking Introductions

### 20-Second Elevator Pitch
```
"I'm Chris Lee. I ran a web agency in Korea with 9 employees. Was spending $10K a month on software subscriptions. So I quit everything, moved to Vancouver, and now I use AI to build my own tools. I make one new tool every week and show people exactly how I did it."
```

### 1-Minute Introduction
```
"I'm Chris Lee. I dropped out of design school in Korea and built a web agency up to 9 employees and $600K a year. Had 40K YouTube subscribers following the journey. Even worked with LINE on big projects.

But I realized something scary. MY customer data was in THEIR database. MY business was behind THEIR API limits. One shutdown, one price hike, and I could lose everything.

So I quit. Sold everything. Moved to Vancouver. Started learning to use AI to build my own tools. Now every week, I pick one tool I was paying for, build my own version in about 20 hours, and share the whole process on YouTube. 

I've built 23 tools so far. Each one works exactly how I need it. No monthly fees. No waiting. Just build what I need."
```

### 3-Minute Story
```
"I dropped out of design school in Korea when I was 20. Everyone said I was crazy. Started a web agency with nothing - just me and a laptop.

Five years later, I had 9 employees, $600K in yearly revenue, and 40,000 YouTube subscribers watching me share every win and every failure. I was working with companies like LINE. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador. By Korean standards, I'd made it.

But something was wrong. I looked at my business and realized:

**MY customer data... in THEIR database.**
**MY business processes... behind THEIR API limits.**
**MY entire operation... at THEIR mercy.**

One price hike, one shutdown, one acquisition - and I could lose everything. I didn't own my business. I was just renting it from software companies.

So I made a crazy decision. I sold the agency. Left Korea. Moved to Vancouver. And started learning to use AI to build my own software.

My first project was replacing Circle.so. Took me 20 hours to build exactly what I needed. Then ConvertKit - 15 hours. Calendly - 12 hours. Each tool, built exactly how I wanted it.

Now I do this every week. Pick a tool, build it, share the process on YouTube. Every error, every breakthrough, every line of code. Because I realized something: I'm not special. If I can do this, anyone can.

I'm still figuring things out. Still making mistakes. But at least now I own the tools that run my business. And that changes everything."

## Q&A Responses

### "What do you do?"
**Short**: "I build my own software with AI and teach others how to do it."

**Medium**: "I used to run a web agency in Korea. Now I use AI to build my own software tools instead of paying for them. Every week I build something new and share how I did it on YouTube."

### "Why did you quit your successful agency?"
"I was spending $10K a month on software and had no control over any of it. Couldn't get the features I needed. Prices kept going up. So I decided to learn how to build my own tools instead."

### "How did you learn to code?"
"I don't really code in the traditional way. I use AI tools to help me build. It's more like having a conversation with a really smart assistant who writes the code for me. Anyone can learn it."

### "What's been the hardest part?"
"Leaving everything behind in Korea. I had a successful business, employees who depended on me, a growing YouTube channel. But I wasn't happy just renting tools from other companies. Sometimes you have to give up good to find great."

### "What's your goal?"
"I want every business owner to own their tools, not rent them. Our kids will think we were crazy for paying monthly subscriptions for basic software."
