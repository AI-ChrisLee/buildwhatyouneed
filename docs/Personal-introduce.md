# Personal Introduction Hub - Chris Lee

## Core Identity
**I build micro SaaS that I control, educate my community, and share my journey on YouTube.**

I dropped out of design school in Korea and started a web agency with just a laptop.

We grew it to 9 employees and $600K revenue. Built a 40K YouTube following by sharing the journey. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador.

Then SaaS companies denied my feature requests. Hit API limits during launches. Doubled prices overnight. I realized I didn't own my business—I was renting it.

I moved to Vancouver to start fresh. Now I build my own micro SaaS using AI instead of renting from others.

I build micro SaaS that I control, educate my community, and share my journey on YouTube.

I'm documenting this new journey. I share not only how I build each tool but the mistakes I make and the walls I hit. This channel revolves around owning your business tools instead of renting them.

By no means am I claiming to have all the answers. I'm still figuring things out as I go along.

## LinkedIn About Section
```
I ran a web agency in Korea. 9 employees. $600K/year. 40K YouTube subscribers.

Worked with big companies like LINE. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador. But something was fundamentally wrong:

**MY customer data... stuck in THEIR computers**
**MY business... limited by THEIR rules**
**MY feature requests... ignored**

The breaking point: They said NO to features I needed. Hit API limits during a launch. Prices doubled overnight.

I wasn't running a business. I was renting one.

So I quit everything. Sold the agency. Left Korea. Moved to Vancouver.

Now I use AI to build my own micro SaaS. Every week, I pick one tool I'm tired of renting and build my own version. Takes about 20 hours. Then I OWN it forever.

I've built replacements for Circle.so, ConvertKit, Calendly, and 20+ other tools. Each one works exactly how I need it. Need a feature? I add it today. Want integration? Done. No asking permission.

The problem was never money. It was control.

Currently living in Vancouver, taking back control of my business tools, one build at a time. Join me on YouTube where I show exactly how.

## Networking Introductions

### 20-Second Elevator Pitch
```
"I'm Chris Lee. I ran a web agency in Korea with 9 employees. But I realized I didn't own my business—the software companies did. So I quit everything, moved to Vancouver, and now I use AI to build my own tools. I own everything. No more asking permission for features I need."
```

### 1-Minute Introduction
```
"I'm Chris Lee. I dropped out of design school in Korea and built a web agency up to 9 employees and $600K a year. Had 40K YouTube subscribers following the journey. Even worked with LINE on big projects.

But here's what broke me: They said NO to my feature request. Hit API limits during a launch. Prices doubled overnight. I realized MY customer data was stuck in THEIR computers. MY business was limited by THEIR rules.

I wasn't running a business. I was renting one.

So I quit. Sold everything. Moved to Vancouver. Started using AI to build my own tools. Now every week, I pick one tool I'm tired of renting, build my own version in about 20 hours, and OWN it forever. 

I've built 23 tools so far. Each one works exactly how I want. Need a feature? I add it today. The problem was never money. It was control."
```

### 3-Minute Story
```
"I dropped out of design school in Korea when I was 20. Everyone said I was crazy. Started a web agency with nothing - just me and a laptop.

Five years later, I had 9 employees, $600K in yearly revenue, and 40,000 YouTube subscribers watching me share every win and every failure. I was working with companies like LINE. Even became a Naver AI Ambassador. By Korean standards, I'd made it.

But here's what broke me:

**Feature request: DENIED**
**API limits hit during product launch**
**Price doubled overnight. No warning.**

I realized the truth:

**MY customer data... stuck in THEIR computers**
**MY business... limited by THEIR rules**
**MY entire operation... controlled by THEIR decisions**

I wasn't a business owner. I was a hostage.

So I made a crazy decision. I sold the agency. Left Korea. Moved to Vancouver. And started learning to use AI to build my own software.

My first micro SaaS replaced Circle.so—they wouldn't let me customize profiles. Took me 20 hours to build exactly what I needed. Then ConvertKit—they had a 25 automation limit. Built my own in 15 hours. Calendly—couldn't set my weird scheduling hours. 12 hours later, I owned it.

Now I do this every week. Pick a tool that's holding me hostage, build my own version, and take back control. Then I share the whole process on YouTube.

23 tools built. 23 pieces of my business I now control. No more begging for features. No more limits. No more surprises.

The problem was never money. It was control. And now I have it."

## Q&A Responses

### "What do you do?"
**Short**: "I build micro SaaS I control, not rent. I show others how to own their tools too."

**Medium**: "I used to run a web agency in Korea. Got tired of software companies controlling my business. Now I use AI to build my own tools. Every week I take back control of one more tool and show how on YouTube."

### "Why did you quit your successful agency?"
"They said NO to my feature request. Hit API limits during a launch. Prices doubled overnight. I realized I didn't own my business—the software companies did. I was just a hostage paying rent. So I quit to take back control."

### "How did you learn to code?"
"I don't code in the traditional way. I use AI to build what I need. It's not about being a programmer—it's about owning your tools instead of renting them. The AI does the coding. I just tell it what I want."

### "What's been the hardest part?"
"Realizing I was a hostage, not a business owner. I had success in Korea—9 employees, $600K revenue, 40K subscribers. But every tool could shut down, raise prices, or deny my features. Walking away from 'success' to gain control was hard but necessary."

### "What's your goal?"
"I want every business owner to realize they're hostages, not owners. When you rent your tools, you rent your business. My goal? Show people how to take back control. Build what you need. Own what you build."
