## Remember: Build What You Need

Throughout every phase, maintain focus on:
1. **Simplicity** - No feature bloat
2. **Speed** - Ship fast, iterate later
3. **Value** - Every feature must save members money
4. **Transparency** - Show everything, hide nothing
5. **Revolution** - We're changing how software is built

The goal isn't to build the perfect platform. It's to build exactly what our members need to escape SaaS slavery. Nothing more, nothing less.
