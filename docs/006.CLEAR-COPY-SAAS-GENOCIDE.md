## The 3 Problems We Solve

### ⚠️ Problem 1: You Own Nothing
They raise prices. They shut down. They change everything. Your business data is trapped in their system.

### 🚫 Problem 2: You Need Features NOW  
You beg for features. They say "maybe next quarter." Your business suffers while you wait for permission to grow.

### 💸 Problem 3: You're Funding Their VCs
You're paying $3,000-5,000/month for SaaS tools. That's $36K-60K yearly going to their next funding round.
