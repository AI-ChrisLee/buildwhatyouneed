## Welcome to AI Chris Lee

I'm Chris Lee. I build my own software using AI. Now I control every tool in my business.

**The problem wasn't money. It was control.**

**MY customer data... stuck in THEIR computers.**

**MY business... limited by THEIR rules.**

**If they shut down or raise prices, I'm screwed.**

Every week, I pick a tool I'm tired of renting. I build my own version with AI in 20 hours. Then I own it forever. I show you exactly how on YouTube - every step, every mistake, every win.

My goal: Share how I built my own tools so you can too. When you own the tools, you own your future. No more begging for features. No more surprise shutdowns. Just you, AI, and total control.

This is where I share what worked for me. This is where we figure it out together.

## The Declaration 

I'm not a coder. I'm a business owner who figured out something scary:

**Other companies control my business more than I do.**

All my important stuff runs on their computers. My customer list is in their system. If they stop working, I stop working. They decide how much I can grow.

Now I have one goal: **Build what I need. Own everything. Using AI.**

**The change**: We're done renting. We're building. Our kids will laugh that we used to pay monthly for basic tools.

**My progress**: 1 new tool built every week. Each one I build is mine forever.

## Who I Am (And Why This Works)

**I'm AI Chris Lee.**

Built a $600K agency in Korea. 40K people follow my YouTube. Was paying for tools like:
- Circle (community platform)
- Webflow (website builder)  
- Zapier (automation)
- Make (workflows)
- GoHighLevel (CRM)

**The breaking point**: They said no to my feature request. Hit limits during a big launch. Prices doubled without warning. I realized I was just renting, not owning.

Then I learned to build with AI. Now I can make any tool I need in days, not years.

Started building my own tools one by one. Each one documented on YouTube. Each built with AI helping me code.

**The path**: From renter → Owner → Guy who shows you what worked

**The formula**: AI + simple coding + 20 hours = You own it

**The brand**: AI Chris Lee - where business owners share what works
**The system**: Control OS - take control of your business tools

## The "Control in My Backyard" Philosophy

### I Don't Care About Saving Money

**I spend $10,000/month on tools. That's fine. They make me money.**

But here's what drives me crazy:
- **My customer list is on THEIR computer**
- **They decide how fast I can grow**  
- **They ignore what I need for MY business**
- **If they sell or shut down, I'm done**

**Money isn't the problem. Control is.**

Every tool I rent is another boss telling me what I can't do. Every "no" to my requests reminds me: **I'm just a user, not an owner.**

### What "Control in My Backyard" Means

When you rent software, you're farming on someone else's land:
- They change the UI? You adapt or leave
- They raise prices? You pay or lose your data  
- They ignore your feature request? You beg or suffer
- They get acquired? You pray nothing changes
- They shut down? You scramble to migrate

**But when you own your tools, you own your destiny:**
- Need a feature? Build it today
- Want an integration? Add it now
- Hate the workflow? Change it immediately
- Business pivots? Your tools pivot with you

### Why Building Beats Renting

**Employee thinking**: "Why spend 20 hours when I can pay $99/month?"

**Owner thinking**: "Why let them control my business when I can control it?"

What happens over time:
- Year 1: Own 52 tools (one per week)
- Year 2: Change them instantly when you need to
- Year 3: Run your business without depending on anyone
- Year 10: Build new features in hours while others wait months

**This isn't about saving money. It's about being the boss of your own business.**

### Why Owning Is Safer

**Problems with renting**:
- They own your data (not you)
- Prices go up (you can't stop it)
- Features disappear (too bad for you)
- Company gets sold (new rules)
- Service shuts down (you lose everything)

**Why owning is better**:
- Your data stays yours (on your computer)
- Costs stay the same (just hosting)
- Features never leave (you built them)
- Always works (doesn't need them)
- Do things others can't (custom for you)

### The Control Equation

I don't build to save money. I build to take back power:

1. **Control = Survival**: When they control your tools, they control your business
2. **Ownership = Security**: No shutdown can touch what you own
3. **Customization = Dominance**: Build features your competitors can't access
4. **Freedom = Power**: Do what you want without asking

**The big question**: Who runs your business? You or them?

**The painful truth**: Every SaaS subscription is a vote for "them."

## What Control OS Really Is

### This Isn't About Learning to Code

I'm not some coding guru. I'm just showing you what I did to own my business.

When I build a tool? You see freedom.
When they panic? We don't care anymore.
When others join us? Another business takes control.

**"The problem was never money. It was control. MY customers in THEIR system. MY business following THEIR rules. If they shut down, I'm done."

**Not with Control OS.**

### How It Works

**Who I am**: AI Chris Lee - Just a guy who figured this out
**The System**: Control OS - Own your business tools
**The Community**: Where we all build together
**The Promise**: Control your tools, control your future

### What You Get to See

- **Watch me build**: Every tool I make, step by step
- **Get the code**: Copy exactly what I built
- **Join the builders**: Your tool wishlist, my methods
- **Share wins**: More tools owned = stronger business

### Why This Works

Tool companies think you need them. They think building is too hard.

We're proving them wrong. One tool at a time.

### Yes, We Still Use Some Tools

**We use tools to build tools. Here's why:**
- Cursor helps us code faster (for now)
- Claude answers our questions (until we build our own)
- Supabase stores our data (for now)
- Vercel makes things go live (while we need it)

**The difference**: These are just helpers. We use them to build our own stuff. Once we're ready, we'll replace them too.

**Think of it like this**: Even builders buy hammers before making their own.

## How to Build Your Own Tools

## The 4 Step Control Blueprint

*This is exactly how I do it. Follow these steps and you'll own your tools too.*

---

### Step 1: Pick Your Target
**Choose the tool that bugs you most and figure out what you actually need.**

#### How to Pick
**Which tool made you mad this week? Start there.**

**The Selection Criteria:**
- Ignored your feature request? → Time to build your own
- Raised prices again? → Take back control immediately
- Changed UI without asking? → Design it YOUR way
- API limits blocking you? → Remove all limits forever

**The Exercise:**
1. List every SaaS you pay for
2. Write what control you've lost with each
3. Sort by business criticality (which hurts your operations most?)
4. Pick the one that limits your growth the most
5. That's your first target—because ROI starts with removing bottlenecks

**My Hit List Example:**
- Circle.so - $99/month - "Can't customize member profiles" → DEAD ✅
- ConvertKit - $290/month - "Automation limits are a joke" → DEAD ✅
- Calendly - $144/month - "Can't add my weird availability" → DEAD ✅
- Kajabi - $199/month - "Checkout flow is garbage" → NEXT TO LIBERATE 🎯

#### Figure Out What You Need
**What features do you actually use? (Usually just a few)**

**Find What You Really Use:**
1. Watch what you actually click for 1 week
2. Take screenshots of features you use
3. Write down what you need it to do
4. Ignore everything else (you don't need it)

**Use This Template:**
```
TOOL: [Name]
MONTHLY COST: $[Amount]
FEATURES I ACTUALLY USE:
- Feature 1 (how often)
- Feature 2 (how often)
- Feature 3 (how often)
FEATURES I'M FORCED TO PAY FOR: [List the 90% you never touch]
TIME TO BUILD MY VERSION: [Estimate]
```

**Real Example - My Calendly Recon:**
- Used: Basic scheduling (daily)
- Used: Calendar sync (critical)
- Used: Timezone detection (important)
- NEVER used: Team features, payment collection, video integration, 47 other "features"
- Build time: 12 hours for what I ACTUALLY need

---

### Step 2: Build It
**Make exactly what you need. AI does the hard parts.**

#### Start Simple
**Build only what you use. Skip everything else.**

**The Build Order (Never Skip Steps):**
1. **Wireframe** - Sketch the UI. Ugly is fine. Function over form.
2. **Database** - Design your schema. What data do you actually need?
3. **Backend** - APIs, auth, the boring stuff that makes it work.
4. **Polishing** - Make it feel good. Add dark mode. Ship it.

**Tools I Use (Yeah, I Still Use Some Tools):**
- **Cursor** - Your AI coding partner
- **Claude** - AI that answers questions
- **Supabase** - Your database bunker
- **Supabase MCP** - Direct database control through AI
- **GitHub MCP** - Version control at AI speed
- **Vercel** - Your deployment missile
- **Git** - Your version control armor

*Note: With MCP, AI can directly help build things faster*

**The Paradox We Accept:**
Look, I know. We use some tools to build our own tools. Someday I'll replace these too. But right now? They help us build faster. Even builders need hammers.

**Your Build Schedule:**
- Day 1: Wireframe (2-3 hours)
- Day 2: Database design (2 hours)
- Day 3-4: Backend build (8-10 hours)
- Day 5: Polish and deploy (4 hours)
- Day 6: Migration and testing
- Day 7: Show the world

**What I Tell Claude:**
```
"Help me build a [SaaS name] replacement with these exact features I use:
- [Feature 1 I actually need]
- [Feature 2 I actually need]  
- [Feature 3 I actually need]
Skip everything else. Use Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, shadcn UI.
We have Supabase MCP for direct database control.
This is about control. Keep it lean."
```

---

### Step 3: Improve - Add Your Features
**Add what they refused to give you. Make it work YOUR way.**

**The Revenge List:**
- That feature they said was "too complex"? Build it.
- That workflow they said "nobody needs"? Add it.
- That integration they wanted $50/month for? Include it.
- That limit they imposed? Remove it.

**My Favorite Revenge Features:**
- Calendly clone: Added "chaos mode" scheduling for my weird hours
- ConvertKit clone: Unlimited automation steps (their limit was 25)
- Circle clone: Member profiles exactly how I wanted
- Every clone: Dark mode (because they didn't have it)

---

### Step 4: Liberate - Export & Cancel
**Export your data, migrate everything, then cancel forever.**

**The Liberation Checklist:**
1. Export all customer data (CSV minimum)
2. Export all content/products
3. Export all automations/workflows
4. Screenshot all analytics you care about
5. Document all integrations
6. Save all templates
7. Download all assets

**How to Move Your Data:**
```python
# Your liberation script template
1. Read their export
2. Transform to your schema
3. Import to your database
4. Verify everything moved
5. Run parallel for 1 week
6. Then execute them
```

**Pro Liberation Tips:**
- Some SaaS make export hard ON PURPOSE
- Use their API to extract if needed
- Web scraping is fair game (they started this war)
- Keep backups until you're 100% migrated

**Testing Phase:**
- Run both tools in parallel for 1 week
- Compare outputs to ensure accuracy
- Fix any migration issues
- Build confidence before the switch

#### Show Off What You Built
**Let everyone see what owning looks like.**

**How to Share Your Win:**

**1. Show What You Built**
- Screenshot YOUR control panel
- Show YOUR data in YOUR system
- Demo features they said "no" to
- Show how it works perfect for YOU

**2. The Ownership Post**
```
I now control @[SaaSName]'s functionality ✅

What I built: [Your tool name]
Build time: [X] hours
Control gained: COMPLETE

Features they denied me:
✓ [Feature 1 you added]
✓ [Feature 2 you built]
✓ [Custom workflow you created]

Now I own it. Forever.
No monthly ransom. No feature begging.
Just pure control in my backyard.

- Demonstrate the custom features YOU needed
- Prove the ROI through actual usage

**4. The YouTube Control Video**
- Demo your new tool in action
- Show the features you now control

**Option A: Show The Process**
- Record how I built it
- Share in the community
- Help others copy it
- Make templates

**Option B: The Victory Share**
- Just share screenshots
- Show the savings
- Inspire others to build
- Keep code private

## My Weekly Routine: Plan - Build - Share - Viral

This is exactly what I do every week. Four steps that work for me.

### Phase 1: PLAN
**What**: Choose the perfect target for maximum controversy and impact.

**Planning first**:
- **Title & Thumbnail First**: Create controversial hook BEFORE building
- **Target Selection**: Pick one SaaS that EVERYONE hates paying for
- **Deep Analysis**: Research everything - their pricing, features, customer complaints
- **Extraction Strategy**: Document exactly what to build and what to ignore
- **Controversy Package**: Frame it to trigger maximum engagement

**Example planning**:
```
TARGET: Calendly
TITLE: "I Replaced Calendly in 12 Hours (Now I Control Time)"
THUMBNAIL: Calendly logo with red X, my face looking intense
ANGLE: "They charge $144/year for a f***ing calendar"
HOOK: Show their pricing page vs my $0 forever
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours planning what to build

**Key**: Plan the viral story FIRST, then build to match the narrative.

### Phase 2: BUILD
**What**: Execute the plan with surgical precision.

**The sacred order**:
1. **Wireframe** (2-3 hours) - Design exactly what the story needs
2. **Database** (2 hours) - Structure for the features that matter
3. **Backend** (8-10 hours) - Build the core functionality
4. **Polishing** (4 hours) - Make it look better than theirs

**The build mindset**:
- Build for the story you planned
- Add controversial features they refuse to build
- Document every error for educational content
- Ship when it matches your viral angle

**Time**: 15-20 hours of focused building

**Key**: Every feature supports the viral narrative you planned.

### Phase 3: SHARE
**What**: Show everyone exactly how I built it, mistakes and all.

**How I share**:
- **Weekly Updates**: New tool built = New stuff to share
- **Clone-First Learning**: Show them how to copy my EXACT workflow
- **Error Library**: Every mistake I made, documented with solutions
- **Template Drops**: Working code they can deploy immediately
- **Live Sessions**: Help fix problems when people get stuck

**What I share with the community**:
```
WEEK 1 COURSE: "Calendly Liberation"
Module 1: Why You Need Calendar Control (mindset)
Module 2: The 12-Hour Build Plan (strategy)
Module 3: Database Design for Scheduling (technical)
Module 4: Error #1-15 and Solutions (shortcuts)
Module 5: Deploy Your Own Calendly Replacement (action)
BONUS: My exact codebase as template
```

**Distribution**:
- Community gets FULL technical breakdowns
- Step-by-step replication guides
- Live coding sessions showing the messy parts
- Templates and boilerplates included

**Key**: Everyone copies what I did, including the mistakes.

### Phase 4: VIRAL
**What**: Package everything into Netflix-style storytelling for YouTube.

**The viral formula**:
- **Documentary Style**: High production value, emotional journey
- **Story Arc**: Problem → Struggle → Breakthrough → Victory
- **The 4 Step Control Blueprint**: Package our process as entertainment
- **Getting Views**: Thumbnail, title, first 15 seconds = EVERYTHING

**Production approach**:
```
STRUCTURE: "The Day I Liberated My Calendar"
0:00 - Cold open: "Calendly wanted $144/year..."
0:15 - The pricing page that triggered me
1:00 - The build montage (time-lapse)
3:00 - The error that almost stopped me
5:00 - The breakthrough moment
7:00 - Live demo crushing their features
9:00 - The cancellation ceremony
10:00 - "Your turn. Link below."
```

**YouTube tips**:
- Storytelling > How-to guides (save details for community)
- Emotion > Information (anger, triumph, revenge)
- Entertainment > Education (they'll join to learn HOW)
- Weekly schedule: Sunday = New builds go live

**Metrics that matter**:
- Views (reach)
- Watch time (engagement)
- Comments (controversy working)
- Community conversions (viewers → builders)

**Key**: YouTube is entertainment that converts. Community is where they learn to replicate.

---

## Why This Routine Works

### Smart Planning
Title and thumbnail FIRST ensures every build serves the viral narrative. No wasted builds.

### Building Focus
Build phase stays tight because you planned the exact story. Every feature has purpose.

### Sharing What Works
Each build becomes something to share. Everyone copies what worked for me. We all grow together.

### Making It Spread
YouTube is for stories, not tutorials. Views bring people in. Stories convert.

### Everything Adds Up
Plan → Build → Share → Viral. Each step leads to the next. Every week gets better.

---

## How We Measure Success

**YouTube** → **Website** → **Free Members** → **Paid Members** → **Tools Built** → **share there story in our business**

What really matters:
- Tools you own (not rent)
- Tools built this month
- Time saved forever
- Members building their own tools
- Important stuff YOU control

---

## The Truth

I'm AI Chris Lee. Look, I'm not trying to be friends with tool companies. I'm just sharing what worked for me.

Every tool they charge for? We can build it.
Every feature they won't add? We'll add it.
Every price increase? Time to build your own.

**Join us or keep renting. Your choice.**

---

## How Control OS Works

### Build What You Actually Use
Don't build tools you don't need. Start with what bugs you most.

### Share Your Wins
When you cancel, tell them why. When you build, show others how.

### Everyone Can Build
Big company or small, we all deserve to own our tools.

### Help Others Build
Share your code. The more builders, the better.

### If It Matters, Own It
If a tool is important to your business, you should own it.

---

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't about hurting companies. It's about owning your business.

### What's Happening

**Before AI**: Only developers could build. We were all hostages.
- Pay $500+/month for tools that "almost" work
- Beg for features that never come
- Accept price hikes or lose your data
- Live on rented digital land

**After AI**: Every entrepreneur can build. The hostage situation ends.
- Build exactly what you need in hours
- Add any feature you want instantly
- Own your tools forever
- Pay $0/month for life

### What Victory Looks Like

**Every business owner takes control**
- You don't rent tools. You own them.
- You don't ask for features. You build them.
- You don't worry about price hikes. You worry about nothing.

**Every business owns their tools**
- Your CRM matches your exact sales process
- Your tools integrate perfectly (same codebase)
- Your data lives in YOUR database
- Your costs are fixed forever (hosting only)

**Every SaaS company faces extinction**
- Customers leaving in droves
- "Build it yourself" becomes the norm
- Monthly recurring revenue → monthly recurring cancellations
- The rental model dies

### The Compound Revolution

**Year 1: The First Wave (You)**
- 52 tools liberated
- You own everything you use
- ROI: Control of your entire business
- Movement sparked

**Year 2: The Avalanche (Your Army)**
- 1,000 builders activated
- 52,000 tools built and owned
- Thousands of businesses regain control
- SaaS companies panic

**Year 3: The New Normal (Everyone)**
- "Why would you rent software?"
- Building becomes standard
- SaaS model collapses
- Ownership wins

### The Real Victory

It's not about the money. We're businessmen—ROI is what matters.
It's not about spending less. It's about owning more.

It's about this: **Control in your backyard**.

When you own every tool in your business...
When you can modify anything in hours...
When you fear no price hike or shutdown...

You don't just run a business. You run an empire.

### The New World Order

The future belongs to people who build. Not people who rent. Not people who beg. People who build.

And with AI, we're all builders now.

The question isn't "Which SaaS should I use?"
The question is "Which tool should I reclaim first?"

**Welcome to the age of owning your business.**
