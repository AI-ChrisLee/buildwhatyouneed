# Control OS by AI Chris Lee

## Who I Am

I'm Chris Lee. Built a $600K agency in Korea. 40K YouTube followers. Was paying $10K/month for tools like Circle, Webflow, Zapier, Make, GoHighLevel.

**The breaking point**: They said no to my feature request. Hit limits during a launch. Prices doubled overnight. I realized I wasn't running a businessâ€”I was renting one.

Then I learned to build with AI. Now I own 23 tools that work exactly how I want them.

**The problem wasn't money. It was control.**
- MY customer data... stuck in THEIR computers
- MY business... limited by THEIR rules  
- If they shut down or raise prices, I'm screwed

**My solution**: Build what I need. Own everything. Using AI.

## What is Control OS?

Control OS isn't just another community. It's a system for taking back control of your business tools.

**Who I am**: Just a guy who figured this out  
**What we do**: Build our own tools instead of renting them  
**The promise**: Control your tools, control your future

Every week I pick a tool I'm tired of renting, build my own version with AI in 20 hours, and own it forever. Then I show you exactly how on YouTube.

This isn't about learning to code. It's about owning your business.

## The Philosophy: Control in My Backyard

**I spend $10,000/month on tools. That's fine. They make me money.**

But here's what drives me crazy:
- My customer list is on THEIR computer
- They decide how fast I can grow
- They ignore what I need for MY business
- If they sell or shut down, I'm done

**When you rent:**
- They change things? You deal with it
- They raise prices? You pay or leave
- You need a feature? You beg and wait
- New owner? Hope they're nice

**When you own:**
- Need a feature? Build it today
- Want integration? Add it now
- Don't like something? Change it
- Business pivots? Your tools pivot with you

## The 4-Step Blueprint

### Step 1: Pick Your Target
Choose the tool that bugs you most. Which one said no to your feature request? Which one has stupid limits? Start there.

**My hit list**:
- Circle.so â†’ Can't customize profiles â†’ BUILT âœ…
- ConvertKit â†’ 25 automation limit â†’ BUILT âœ…
- Calendly â†’ Can't set weird hours â†’ BUILT âœ…
- Kajabi â†’ Terrible checkout â†’ NEXT ðŸŽ¯

### Step 2: Build It (20 hours)
1. **Wireframe** (3 hours) - Sketch what you need
2. **Database** (2 hours) - Structure your data
3. **Backend** (10 hours) - Make it work
4. **Polish** (5 hours) - Make it nice

**Tools we use** (yeah, we still use some):
- Cursor & Claude - AI helps code
- Supabase - Database
- Vercel - Goes live
- *We'll replace these too eventually*

### Step 3: Add Your Features
Build what they refused:
- That "too complex" feature? Add it
- That $50/month integration? Include it
- Those annoying limits? Remove them

### Step 4: Move Your Data & Cancel
Export everything. Import to your tool. Test for a week. Then cancel forever.

## The Bigger Picture

**Before AI**: Only developers could build. We were hostages.
**After AI**: Anyone can build. The hostage situation ends.

What happens when everyone builds:
- Year 1: You own 52 tools
- Year 2: 1,000 builders join
- Year 3: "Why would anyone rent software?"

The future belongs to people who build, not people who rent.
