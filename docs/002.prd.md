## 7. What We're NOT Building

### 7.1 Feature Bloat to Avoid
- ❌ Mobile apps (web is enough)
- ❌ AI chatbots (direct human support)
- ❌ Gamification (no points, badges, levels)
- ❌ Social features (no friends, follows, likes)
- ❌ Analytics dashboards (basic metrics only)
- ❌ Multiple pricing tiers (ONE price)
- ❌ Annual plans (monthly only for now)
- ❌ Affiliate program (organic growth)
- ❌ API access (not a platform)
- ❌ White labeling (not our model)

### 7.2 Complexity to Resist
- ❌ A/B testing (pick one way)
- ❌ Personalization (everyone gets same experience)
- ❌ Recommendation engine (all content is valuable)
- ❌ Advanced search (basic is enough)
- ❌ Email automation (simple broadcasts)
- ❌ In-app messaging (use existing tools)
- ❌ Progressive web app (just a website)
- ❌ Integrations (we're replacing them)

## 11. The ONE Thing

If we could only build ONE feature, it would be:

**A simple way for members to access daily source code that replaces their SaaS tools.**

Everything else supports this core value delivery. No feature should exist that doesn't directly help members build what they need and cancel SaaS subscriptions.

---

## 12. Success Definition

The platform succeeds when:
1. 1000 entrepreneurs pay $97/month
2. 500+ SaaS subscriptions cancelled collectively
3. Members build their own tools confidently
4. The revolution becomes self-sustaining
5. We prove builders beat bullshitters

---

**Remember**: This isn't about building the perfect community platform. It's about building exactly what our members need to escape SaaS slavery. Every decision should be filtered through this lens: "Does this help members cancel a SaaS subscription?"

**Build What You Need. Nothing Else.**
