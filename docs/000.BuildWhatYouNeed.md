## The Brand Structure

**Community Name**: AI Chris Lee  
**Movement Name**: The SaaS Genocide  
**Leader**: Chris Lee (AI Chris Lee)  
**Mission**: End software rental forever  
**Method**: Build what you need, kill what you rent

## Welcome to AI Chris Lee

I'm Chris Lee. I use AI and vibe coding to take back control of my business infrastructure. ROI isn't measured in dollars saved‚Äîit's measured in sovereignty gained.

Every week, I pick a tool I'm sick of paying for, build a better version with AI in 20 hours, and kill the subscription. Then I share the entire process on YouTube - every error, every breakthrough, every line of code.

My mission: Show entrepreneurs the ultimate ROI‚Äîowning your tech stack. When you control the tools, you control your business destiny. No vendor lock-in. No surprise shutdowns. Just you, AI, and complete control in your backyard.

This is the AI Chris Lee community. This is where I lead The SaaS Genocide. This is where entrepreneurs learn to build, not rent.

## The Declaration of War

I'm not a developer. I'm a businessman who realized the worst ROI in tech is renting instead of owning.

Now I'm on a mission: Take back control of every tool in my business. Build what I need. Own everything. Because control in my backyard is the best long-term investment.

**The revolution**: We're the generation that ends software rental. Our kids will laugh that we used to pay monthly for calculators.

**My kill rate**: 1 SaaS death per week. Because every tool I own is an asset that appreciates.

---

## Who I Am (And Why I'm Dangerous)

**I'm AI Chris Lee.**

Built a $600K agency in Korea. 40K YouTube subscribers documenting the journey. Was bleeding $10,000/month to SaaS companies‚Äînot because I couldn't afford it, but because I was losing CONTROL.

Then I discovered vibe coding with AI. Now I can build any tool I need in days, not months.

Started killing my subscriptions one by one. Circle.so? Built my own. ConvertKit? Replaced it. Calendly? Dead. Each kill documented on YouTube. Each tool built with AI as my coding partner.

**The journey**: From bleeding $10,000/month in control ‚Üí Owning my entire tech stack ‚Üí Teaching others the ROI of sovereignty

**The tools**: AI + vibe coding + 20 hours = Your own SaaS killer

**The brand**: AI Chris Lee - where entrepreneurs learn to build with AI
**The movement**: The SaaS Genocide - our war on software rental

## The Kill Count (Examples)

### Week 1: Murdered Circle.so
- Build time: 20 hours
- Control reclaimed: Complete ownership of community data
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- ROI: Infinite (20 hours vs lifetime ownership)

### Week 2: Executed ConvertKit
- Build time: 15 hours  
- Control seized: Unlimited automation, zero restrictions
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- ROI: Own the entire customer journey forever

### Week 3: Assassinated Calendly
- Build time: 12 hours
- Control taken back: Custom scheduling logic for my business
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- ROI: 12 hours for perpetual calendar sovereignty

**Control achieved so far**: 23 tools now under my command. Complete sovereignty reclaimed. Infinite ROI achieved.

## The "Control in My Backyard" Philosophy

### Why We Don't Care About the Money

I was bleeding $10,000/month to SaaS. But here's the thing‚Äî**I'm a businessman. I don't care about spending money. I care about ROI.**

And the ROI calculation is simple:
- **Renting**: $10K/month √ó 12 months √ó Forever = Infinite cost, zero ownership
- **Building**: 20 hours √ó Once = Infinite ownership, infinite control

**The real cost isn't the money. It's the control you surrender.**

### What "Control in My Backyard" Means

When you rent software, you're farming on someone else's land:
- They change the UI? You adapt or leave
- They raise prices? You pay or lose your data  
- They ignore your feature request? You beg or suffer
- They get acquired? You pray nothing changes
- They shut down? You scramble to migrate

**But when you own your tools, you own your destiny:**
- Need a feature? Build it today
- Want an integration? Add it now
- Hate the workflow? Change it immediately
- Business pivots? Your tools pivot with you

### The True ROI of Ownership

**Short-term thinking**: "Why spend 20 hours building when I can pay $99/month?"

**Business owner thinking**: "Why rent forever when I can invest 20 hours once?"

The ROI compounds:
- Year 1: Own 52 tools (1 per week)
- Year 2: Modify them as your business grows
- Year 3: Your entire tech stack is custom-fit to YOUR business
- Year 10: You've saved nothing‚Äîbecause saving wasn't the point. You've built an empire where every tool serves YOUR vision.

### Risk Mitigation Through Control

**Renting risks**:
- Vendor lock-in (they own your data)
- Price hikes (no negotiation power)
- Feature removal (goodbye essential workflow)
- Company acquisition (new owners, new rules)
- Service shutdown (start from scratch)

**Owning benefits**:
- Data sovereignty (it's in YOUR database)
- Fixed costs (hosting only)
- Feature permanence (if you built it, you keep it)
- Business continuity (no external dependencies)
- Competitive advantage (tools your competitors can't buy)

### The Businessman's Calculation

I don't build to save money. I build because:
1. **Control = Competitive Advantage**: My tools do exactly what my business needs
2. **Ownership = Asset Creation**: Every tool built is an asset I own forever
3. **Customization = Market Differentiation**: My workflows can't be copied by competitors
4. **Sovereignty = Risk Elimination**: No vendor can disrupt my operations

**Bottom line**: It's not about the $10K/month. It's about who controls your business infrastructure. Them or you?

## What This Movement Really Is

### Not Another Coding Tutorial

I'm not teaching. I'm recruiting soldiers for the SaaS genocide.

When I kill a SaaS? You watch the execution.
When they beg for mercy? We show none.
When their customers join us? We celebrate.

**"Smart businessmen don't save money‚Äîthey invest in control. The best ROI is owning your infrastructure."**

### The AI Chris Lee Community Structure

**The Brand**: AI Chris Lee - Your trusted SaaS assassin
**The Movement**: The SaaS Genocide - Our mission to end software rental
**The Community**: Where builders become killers
**The Promise**: Own everything, rent nothing

### A War Journal with Weapons

- **Watch the kills**: Every SaaS execution, live
- **Get the weapons**: Every line of code that killed them
- **Join the hunt**: Your SaaS hit list, my proven methods
- **Share the spoils**: Dead SaaS = living empire

### Why We'll Win

SaaS companies are soft. They think you need them. They think you're too scared to build.

We're proving them wrong. One execution at a time.

### The Weapons Paradox

**Yes, we use SaaS to kill SaaS. Here's why:**
- Cursor helps us code faster (for now)
- Claude guides our strategy (until we build our own)
- Supabase hosts our weapons (temporarily)
- Vercel deploys our kills (while we need it)

**The difference**: These are tools, not dependencies. We use them to build sovereignty. Once we're strong enough, they're next on the kill list.

**Think of it like this**: Even revolutionaries buy guns before they can forge their own weapons.

## The Systematic Execution Process

## The 4 Step Control Blueprint

*The systematic approach to taking back control of your tech stack. Master this, and you'll own every tool in your business.*

---

### Step 1: Target - Know Your Enemy
**Pick your most hated SaaS and understand exactly what you need from it.**

#### Target Selection (The Hit List)
**Which SaaS pissed you off this week? That's your target.**

**The Selection Criteria:**
- Ignored your feature request? ‚ò†Ô∏è Death sentence
- Raised prices again? ‚ò†Ô∏è Immediate execution
- Changed UI without asking? ‚ò†Ô∏è Public hanging
- API limits blocking you? ‚ò†Ô∏è Slow torture

**The Exercise:**
1. List every SaaS you pay for
2. Write what control you've lost with each
3. Sort by business criticality (which hurts your operations most?)
4. Pick the one that limits your growth the most
5. That's your first kill‚Äîbecause ROI starts with removing bottlenecks

**My Hit List Example:**
- Circle.so - $99/month - "Can't customize member profiles" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- ConvertKit - $290/month - "Automation limits are a joke" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- Calendly - $144/month - "Can't add my weird availability" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- Kajabi - $199/month - "Checkout flow is garbage" ‚Üí NEXT TARGET üéØ

#### Reconnaissance (The 80/20 Analysis)
**What features do you actually use? (Usually 10% of what they offer)**

**The 80/20 Audit:**
1. Track your SaaS usage for 1 week
2. Screenshot every feature you touch
3. List every workflow you need
4. Ignore everything else (it's bloat)

**The Reconnaissance Template:**
```
TARGET: [SaaS Name]
MONTHLY RANSOM: $[Amount]
FEATURES I ACTUALLY USE:
- Feature 1 (how often)
- Feature 2 (how often)
- Feature 3 (how often)
FEATURES I'M FORCED TO PAY FOR: [List the 90% you never touch]
TIME TO BUILD MY VERSION: [Estimate]
```

**Real Example - My Calendly Recon:**
- Used: Basic scheduling (daily)
- Used: Calendar sync (critical)
- Used: Timezone detection (important)
- NEVER used: Team features, payment collection, video integration, 47 other "features"
- Build time: 12 hours for what I ACTUALLY need

---

### Step 2: Clone - Build with AI
**Build exactly what you need using vibe coding and AI.**

#### Clone the Core (Your Minimum Viable Assassination)
**Build exactly what you need. Nothing more.**

**The Build Order (Never Skip Steps):**
1. **Wireframe** - Sketch the UI. Ugly is fine. Function over form.
2. **Database** - Design your schema. What data do you actually need?
3. **Backend** - APIs, auth, the boring stuff that makes it work.
4. **Polishing** - Make it feel good. Add dark mode. Ship it.

**The Weapons of War (Yes, We Use SaaS to Kill SaaS):**
- **Cursor** - Your AI coding rifle
- **Claude** - Your strategic advisor
- **Supabase** - Your database bunker
- **Supabase MCP** - Direct database control through AI
- **GitHub MCP** - Version control at AI speed
- **Vercel** - Your deployment missile
- **Git** - Your version control armor

*Note: With MCP (Model Context Protocol), we're not just using AI‚Äîwe're giving it direct control to build faster*

**The Paradox We Accept:**
Look, I know. We're using SaaS to kill SaaS. Someday I'll kill these too. But right now? They're the weapons we need for the revolution. Even revolutionaries need guns before they can make their own.

**The Execution Timeline:**
- Day 1: Wireframe (2-3 hours)
- Day 2: Database design (2 hours)
- Day 3-4: Backend build (8-10 hours)
- Day 5: Polish and deploy (4 hours)
- Day 6: Migration and testing
- Day 7: Public execution

**The Claude Battle Prompt:**
```
"Help me build a [SaaS name] killer with these exact features I use:
- [Feature 1 I actually need]
- [Feature 2 I actually need]  
- [Feature 3 I actually need]
Skip everything else. Use Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, shadcn UI.
We have Supabase MCP for direct database control.
This is about control. Keep it lean."
```

---

### Step 3: Improve - Add Your Features
**Add what they refused to give you. Make it work YOUR way.**

**The Revenge List:**
- That feature they said was "too complex"? Build it.
- That workflow they said "nobody needs"? Add it.
- That integration they wanted $50/month for? Include it.
- That limit they imposed? Remove it.

**My Favorite Revenge Features:**
- Calendly clone: Added "chaos mode" scheduling for my weird hours
- ConvertKit clone: Unlimited automation steps (their limit was 25)
- Circle clone: Member profiles exactly how I wanted
- Every clone: Dark mode (because they didn't have it)

---

### Step 4: Liberate - Export & Cancel
**Export your data, migrate everything, then cancel forever.**

**The Liberation Checklist:**
1. Export all customer data (CSV minimum)
2. Export all content/products
3. Export all automations/workflows
4. Screenshot all analytics you care about
5. Document all integrations
6. Save all templates
7. Download all assets

**The Import Protocol:**
```python
# Your liberation script template
1. Read their export
2. Transform to your schema
3. Import to your database
4. Verify everything moved
5. Run parallel for 1 week
6. Then execute them
```

**Pro Liberation Tips:**
- Some SaaS make export hard ON PURPOSE
- Use their API to extract if needed
- Web scraping is fair game (they started this war)
- Keep backups until you're 100% migrated

**Testing Phase:**
- Run both tools in parallel for 1 week
- Compare outputs to ensure accuracy
- Fix any migration issues
- Build confidence before the kill

#### The Control Demonstration
**Show the world what ownership looks like. Demonstrate your sovereignty.**

**The Victory Protocol:**

**1. The Control Showcase**
- Screenshot YOUR admin panel
- Show YOUR database with YOUR data
- Demonstrate features THEY said were "impossible"
- Highlight workflows that match YOUR business exactly

**2. The Ownership Post**
```
I now control @[SaaSName]'s functionality ‚úÖ

What I built: [Your tool name]
Build time: [X] hours
Control gained: COMPLETE

Features they denied me:
‚úì [Feature 1 you added]
‚úì [Feature 2 you built]
‚úì [Custom workflow you created]

Now I own it. Forever.
No monthly ransom. No feature begging.
Just pure control in my backyard.

**3. The Business Impact**
- Show how it integrates with YOUR workflow
- Demonstrate the custom features YOU needed
- Prove the ROI through actual usage

**4. The YouTube Control Video**
- Demo your new tool in action
- Show the features you now control
- Explain how it serves YOUR business
- Invite others to take control

#### Share the Victory (Spread the Revolution)
**Open source optional. The kill is what matters.**

**The Sharing Strategy:**

**Option A: The Teaching Kill**
- Record the entire build process
- Share in the community
- Help others replicate
- Create templates

**Option B: The Trophy Kill**
- Just share screenshots
- Show the savings
- Inspire others to kill
- Keep code private

**Option C: The Mass Murder Kit**
- Open source everything
- Create install instructions
- Accept PRs for more features
- Watch their customer base shrink

## My War Routine: Plan - Build - Educate - Viral

This is my non-negotiable system for SaaS genocide at scale. Four phases, every project, designed to go viral.

### Phase 1: PLAN
**What**: Choose the perfect target for maximum controversy and impact.

**The strategic planning**:
- **Title & Thumbnail First**: Create controversial hook BEFORE building
- **Target Selection**: Pick one SaaS that EVERYONE hates paying for
- **Deep Analysis**: Research everything - their pricing, features, customer complaints
- **Extraction Strategy**: Document exactly what to build and what to ignore
- **Controversy Package**: Frame it to trigger maximum engagement

**Example planning**:
```
TARGET: Calendly
TITLE: "I Murdered Calendly in 12 Hours (Now I Control Time)"
THUMBNAIL: Calendly logo with red X, my face looking intense
ANGLE: "They charge $144/year for a f***ing calendar"
HOOK: Show their pricing page vs my $0 forever
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours of strategic warfare planning

**Key**: Plan the viral story FIRST, then build to match the narrative.

### Phase 2: BUILD
**What**: Execute the plan with surgical precision.

**The sacred order**:
1. **Wireframe** (2-3 hours) - Design exactly what the story needs
2. **Database** (2 hours) - Structure for the features that matter
3. **Backend** (8-10 hours) - Build the core functionality
4. **Polishing** (4 hours) - Make it look better than theirs

**The build mindset**:
- Build for the story you planned
- Add controversial features they refuse to build
- Document every error for educational content
- Ship when it matches your viral angle

**Time**: 15-20 hours of focused execution

**Key**: Every feature supports the viral narrative you planned.

### Phase 3: EDUCATE
**What**: Transform your build into step-by-step educational content for the community.

**The education system**:
- **Weekly Course Updates**: New SaaS kill = New course module
- **Clone-First Learning**: Show them how to copy my EXACT workflow
- **Error Library**: Every mistake I made, documented with solutions
- **Template Drops**: Working code they can deploy immediately
- **Office Hours**: Live debugging their attempts to clone

**Community education format**:
```
WEEK 1 COURSE: "Calendly Assassination"
Module 1: Why Calendly Must Die (mindset)
Module 2: The 12-Hour Build Plan (strategy)
Module 3: Database Design for Scheduling (technical)
Module 4: Error #1-15 and Solutions (shortcuts)
Module 5: Deploy Your Own Calendly Killer (action)
BONUS: My exact codebase as template
```

**Distribution**:
- Community gets FULL technical breakdowns
- Step-by-step replication guides
- Live coding sessions showing the messy parts
- Templates and boilerplates included

**Key**: They learn by cloning my exact process, mistakes and all.

### Phase 4: VIRAL
**What**: Package everything into Netflix-style storytelling for YouTube.

**The viral formula**:
- **Documentary Style**: High production value, emotional journey
- **Story Arc**: Problem ‚Üí Struggle ‚Üí Breakthrough ‚Üí Victory
- **The 4 Step Control Blueprint**: Package our process as entertainment
- **View Optimization**: Thumbnail, title, first 15 seconds = EVERYTHING

**Production approach**:
```
STRUCTURE: "The Day I Killed Calendly"
0:00 - Cold open: "Calendly wanted $144/year..."
0:15 - The pricing page that triggered me
1:00 - The build montage (time-lapse)
3:00 - The error that almost killed me
5:00 - The breakthrough moment
7:00 - Live demo crushing their features
9:00 - The cancellation ceremony
10:00 - "Your turn. Link below."
```

**YouTube optimization**:
- Storytelling > Teaching (save teaching for community)
- Emotion > Information (anger, triumph, revenge)
- Entertainment > Education (they'll join to learn HOW)
- Weekly schedule: Sunday = New execution drops

**Metrics that matter**:
- Views (reach)
- Watch time (engagement)
- Comments (controversy working)
- Community conversions (viewers ‚Üí builders)

**Key**: YouTube is entertainment that converts. Community is where they learn to replicate.

---

## Why This Routine Works

### Strategic Planning
Title and thumbnail FIRST ensures every build serves the viral narrative. No wasted builds.

### Execution Focus
Build phase stays tight because you planned the exact story. Every feature has purpose.

### Education Pipeline
Each kill becomes a course. Community learns by cloning your exact process. Scale through replication.

### Viral Engineering
YouTube becomes entertainment, not tutorials. Views drive community growth. Entertainment converts.

### System Compounds
Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Educate ‚Üí Viral. Each phase feeds the next. Each week stronger than the last.

---

## Success Metrics (Control Achieved)

**AI Chris Lee YouTube** ‚Üí **AIChrisLee.com** ‚Üí **Free Followers** ‚Üí **Community Members** ‚Üí **SaaS Killed** ‚Üí **Empires Built**

The only metrics that matter:
- Business processes owned (not rented)
- Control points reclaimed this month
- ROI multiplier (build hours vs infinite ownership)
- Builders achieving tech sovereignty
- Critical infrastructure under YOUR control

---

## The Anti-Pitch

I'm AI Chris Lee. I'm not here to make friends with SaaS founders. I'm here to end them.

Every tool they charge for? We can build it better.
Every feature they gatekeep? We'll add it ourselves.
Every price increase? Another name on our kill list.

**Join the AI Chris Lee community or keep renting. But know this: We're winning.**

---

## Core Principles of Genocide

### Kill Only What You Use
Don't waste time on SaaS you don't subscribe to. Make it personal.

### Public Executions Only
Cancel quietly? No. Make them feel it. Tag them. Tell them why.

### No Mercy, No Exceptions
"But what about small indie SaaS?" They chose monthly rental. They chose death.

### Share the Weapons
Your kill code helps others. The movement grows stronger.

### Revenue or Death
If the SaaS isn't worth killing, you shouldn't be using it.

---

## The Bigger War

This isn't about destroying companies. It's about reclaiming sovereignty.

### The Revolution Timeline

**Before AI**: Only developers could build. We were all hostages.
- Pay $500+/month for tools that "almost" work
- Beg for features that never come
- Accept price hikes or lose your data
- Live on rented digital land

**After AI**: Every entrepreneur can build. The hostage situation ends.
- Build exactly what you need in hours
- Add any feature you want instantly
- Own your tools forever
- Pay $0/month for life

### What Victory Looks Like

**Every entrepreneur becomes sovereign**
- You don't rent tools. You own them.
- You don't request features. You build them.
- You don't fear price hikes. You fear nothing.

**Every business runs on owned infrastructure**
- Your CRM matches your exact sales process
- Your tools integrate perfectly (same codebase)
- Your data lives in YOUR database
- Your costs are fixed forever (hosting only)

**Every SaaS company faces extinction**
- Customers leaving in droves
- "Build it yourself" becomes the norm
- Monthly recurring revenue ‚Üí monthly recurring cancellations
- The rental model dies

### The Compound Revolution

**Year 1: The First Wave (You)**
- 52 SaaS killed
- Complete tech sovereignty achieved
- ROI: Control of your entire business
- Movement sparked

**Year 2: The Avalanche (Your Army)**
- 1,000 builders activated
- 52,000 SaaS executions
- Thousands of businesses regain control
- SaaS companies panic

**Year 3: The New Normal (Everyone)**
- "Why would you rent software?"
- Building becomes standard
- SaaS model collapses
- Ownership wins

### The Real Victory

It's not about the money. We're businessmen‚ÄîROI is what matters.
It's not about spending less. It's about owning more.

It's about this: **Control in your backyard**.

When you own every tool in your business...
When you can modify anything in hours...
When you fear no price hike or shutdown...

You don't just run a business. You run an empire.

### The New World Order

The future belongs to builders. Not renters. Not beggars. Builders.

And with AI, we're all builders now.

The question isn't "Which SaaS should I use?"
The question is "Which SaaS should I kill first?"

**Welcome to the age of Digital Sovereignty.**
