## The Brand Structure

**Community Name**: AI Chris Lee  
**Movement Name**: The SaaS Genocide  
**Leader**: Chris Lee (AI Chris Lee)  
**Mission**: End software rental forever  
**Method**: Build what you need, kill what you rent

## Welcome to AI Chris Lee

I'm Chris Lee. I use AI and vibe coding to build my own software instead of paying for SaaS subscriptions.

Every week, I pick a tool I'm sick of paying for, build a better version with AI in 20 hours, and kill the subscription. Then I share the entire process on YouTube - every error, every breakthrough, every line of code.

My mission: Show entrepreneurs how to use AI to build exactly what they need. No more begging for features. No more monthly ransoms. Just you, AI, and complete ownership of your tech stack.

This is the AI Chris Lee community. This is where I lead The SaaS Genocide movement. This is where entrepreneurs learn to build, not rent.

## The Declaration of War

I'm not a developer. I'm just an entrepreneur who got tired of begging SaaS companies for features.

Now I'm on a mission: Kill every SaaS subscription in my business. Build what I need. Own everything.

**The revolution**: We're the generation that ends software rental. Our kids will laugh that we used to pay monthly for calculators.

**My kill rate**: 1 SaaS death per week. Because each one deserves a proper execution.

---

## Who I Am (And Why I'm Dangerous)

**I'm AI Chris Lee.**

Built a $600K agency in Korea. 40K YouTube subscribers documenting the journey. Was bleeding $3,847/month to SaaS companies.

Then I discovered vibe coding with AI. Now I can build any tool I need in days, not months.

Started killing my subscriptions one by one. Circle.so? Built my own. ConvertKit? Replaced it. Calendly? Dead. Each kill documented on YouTube. Each tool built with AI as my coding partner.

**The journey**: From paying $3,847/month ‚Üí Building everything myself ‚Üí Teaching others the method

**The tools**: AI + vibe coding + 20 hours = Your own SaaS killer

**The brand**: AI Chris Lee - where entrepreneurs learn to build with AI
**The movement**: The SaaS Genocide - our war on software rental

---

## The Kill Count (Real Examples)

### Week 1: Murdered Circle.so
- Build time: 20 hours
- Was paying: $99/month
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Now I own my community forever

### Week 2: Executed ConvertKit
- Build time: 15 hours  
- Was paying: $290/month
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- My email system, my rules

### Week 3: Assassinated Calendly
- Build time: 12 hours
- Was paying: $144/month
- Status: DEAD ‚ò†Ô∏è
- Booking exactly how I want it

**Body count so far**: 23 SaaS companies dead. $2,847/month back in my pocket.

## What This Movement Really Is

### Not Another Coding Tutorial

I'm not teaching. I'm recruiting soldiers for the SaaS genocide.

When I kill a SaaS? You watch the execution.
When they beg for mercy? We show none.
When their customers join us? We celebrate.

**"The best revolutionaries don't just destroy - they show you how to build on the ashes."**

### The AI Chris Lee Community Structure

**The Brand**: AI Chris Lee - Your trusted SaaS assassin
**The Movement**: The SaaS Genocide - Our mission to end software rental
**The Community**: Where builders become killers
**The Promise**: Own everything, rent nothing

### A War Journal with Weapons

- **Watch the kills**: Every SaaS execution, live
- **Get the weapons**: Every line of code that killed them
- **Join the hunt**: Your SaaS hit list, my proven methods
- **Share the spoils**: Dead SaaS = living empire

### Why We'll Win

SaaS companies are soft. They think you need them. They think you're too scared to build.

We're proving them wrong. One execution at a time.

### The Weapons Paradox

**Yes, we use SaaS to kill SaaS. Here's why:**
- Cursor helps us code faster (for now)
- Claude guides our strategy (until we build our own)
- Supabase hosts our weapons (temporarily)
- Vercel deploys our kills (while we need it)

**The difference**: These are tools, not dependencies. We use them to build sovereignty. Once we're strong enough, they're next on the kill list.

**Think of it like this**: Even revolutionaries buy guns before they can forge their own weapons.

## The Systematic Execution Process

## The 4 Step Vibe Blueprint

*The simplified blueprint I use to kill a SaaS every week. Master this, and you'll never pay for software again.*

---

### Step 1: Target - Know Your Enemy
**Pick your most hated SaaS and understand exactly what you need from it.**

#### Target Selection (The Hit List)
**Which SaaS pissed you off this week? That's your target.**

**The Selection Criteria:**
- Ignored your feature request? ‚ò†Ô∏è Death sentence
- Raised prices again? ‚ò†Ô∏è Immediate execution
- Changed UI without asking? ‚ò†Ô∏è Public hanging
- API limits blocking you? ‚ò†Ô∏è Slow torture

**The Exercise:**
1. List every SaaS you pay for
2. Write what pisses you off about each
3. Sort by monthly cost
4. Pick the most expensive annoyance
5. That's your first kill

**My Hit List Example:**
- Circle.so - $99/month - "Can't customize member profiles" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- ConvertKit - $290/month - "Automation limits are a joke" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- Calendly - $144/month - "Can't add my weird availability" ‚Üí DEAD ‚úÖ
- Kajabi - $199/month - "Checkout flow is garbage" ‚Üí NEXT TARGET üéØ

#### Reconnaissance (The 80/20 Analysis)
**What features do you actually use? (Usually 10% of what they offer)**

**The 80/20 Audit:**
1. Track your SaaS usage for 1 week
2. Screenshot every feature you touch
3. List every workflow you need
4. Ignore everything else (it's bloat)

**The Reconnaissance Template:**
```
TARGET: [SaaS Name]
MONTHLY RANSOM: $[Amount]
FEATURES I ACTUALLY USE:
- Feature 1 (how often)
- Feature 2 (how often)
- Feature 3 (how often)
FEATURES I'M FORCED TO PAY FOR: [List the 90% you never touch]
TIME TO BUILD MY VERSION: [Estimate]
```

**Real Example - My Calendly Recon:**
- Used: Basic scheduling (daily)
- Used: Calendar sync (critical)
- Used: Timezone detection (important)
- NEVER used: Team features, payment collection, video integration, 47 other "features"
- Build time: 12 hours for what I ACTUALLY need

---

### Step 2: Clone - Build with AI
**Build exactly what you need using vibe coding and AI.**

#### Clone the Core (Your Minimum Viable Assassination)
**Build exactly what you need. Nothing more.**

**The Build Order (Never Skip Steps):**
1. **Wireframe** - Sketch the UI. Ugly is fine. Function over form.
2. **Database** - Design your schema. What data do you actually need?
3. **Backend** - APIs, auth, the boring stuff that makes it work.
4. **Polishing** - Make it feel good. Add dark mode. Ship it.

**The Weapons of War (Yes, We Use SaaS to Kill SaaS):**
- **Cursor** - Your AI coding rifle
- **Claude** - Your strategic advisor
- **Supabase** - Your database bunker
- **Vercel** - Your deployment missile
- **Git** - Your version control armor

**The Paradox We Accept:**
Look, I know. We're using SaaS to kill SaaS. Someday I'll kill these too. But right now? They're the weapons we need for the revolution. Even revolutionaries need guns before they can make their own.

**The Execution Timeline:**
- Day 1: Wireframe (2-3 hours)
- Day 2: Database design (2 hours)
- Day 3-4: Backend build (8-10 hours)
- Day 5: Polish and deploy (4 hours)
- Day 6: Migration and testing
- Day 7: Public execution

**The Claude Battle Prompt:**
```
"Help me build a [SaaS name] killer with these exact features I use:
- [Feature 1 I actually need]
- [Feature 2 I actually need]  
- [Feature 3 I actually need]
Skip everything else. Use Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind.
This is war. Keep it lean."
```

---

### Step 3: Improve - Add Your Features
**Add what they refused to give you. Make it work YOUR way.**

**The Revenge List:**
- That feature they said was "too complex"? Build it.
- That workflow they said "nobody needs"? Add it.
- That integration they wanted $50/month for? Include it.
- That limit they imposed? Remove it.

**My Favorite Revenge Features:**
- Calendly clone: Added "chaos mode" scheduling for my weird hours
- ConvertKit clone: Unlimited automation steps (their limit was 25)
- Circle clone: Member profiles exactly how I wanted
- Every clone: Dark mode (because they didn't have it)

**The Revenge Sprint:**
- Day 1-2: Clone core
- Day 3: Add YOUR features
- Day 4: Polish and deploy
- Day 5: Start using it
- Day 6: Delete their app
- Day 7: Public execution

---

### Step 4: Liberate - Export & Cancel
**Export your data, migrate everything, then cancel forever.**

**The Liberation Checklist:**
1. Export all customer data (CSV minimum)
2. Export all content/products
3. Export all automations/workflows
4. Screenshot all analytics you care about
5. Document all integrations
6. Save all templates
7. Download all assets

**The Import Protocol:**
```python
# Your liberation script template
1. Read their export
2. Transform to your schema
3. Import to your database
4. Verify everything moved
5. Run parallel for 1 week
6. Then execute them
```

**Pro Liberation Tips:**
- Some SaaS make export hard ON PURPOSE
- Use their API to extract if needed
- Web scraping is fair game (they started this war)
- Keep backups until you're 100% migrated

**Testing Phase:**
- Run both tools in parallel for 1 week
- Compare outputs to ensure accuracy
- Fix any migration issues
- Build confidence before the kill

#### The Cancellation Process
**Cancel publicly. Tag them. Let them know why they died.**

**The Execution Protocol:**

**1. The Screenshot**
- Your cancellation screen
- Your final bill showing $0
- Your new tool in action

**2. The Tweet/Post**
```
Just killed @[SaaSName] ‚ò†Ô∏è

Was paying: $[amount]/month
Build time: [X] hours
Now paying: $0/month forever

They ignored my feature requests for 2 years.
So I built their replacement in a weekend.

- Share in the community
- Help others replicate
- Create templates

**Option B: The Trophy Kill**
- Just share screenshots
- Show the savings
- Inspire others to kill
- Keep code private

**Option C: The Mass Murder Kit**

## My War Routine: Target - Build - Document - Recruit

This is my non-negotiable process. Four phases, every project, no exceptions.

### Phase 1: TARGET
**What**: Pick your most hated SaaS. The one that ignored your feature requests.

**The process**:
- Review your subscription list (the death row)
- Check your feature request history (the evidence)
- Calculate monthly ransom (the motivation)
- Feel the anger (the fuel)
- Pick your victim (the target)

**Time**: 1 hour of pure hatred

**Key**: Make it personal. Revenge builds better than tutorials.

### Phase 2: BUILD
**What**: Follow the build order religiously. No shortcuts.

**The sacred order**:
1. **Wireframe** (2-3 hours) - Sketch what you need
2. **Database** (2 hours) - Design your data structure  
3. **Backend** (8-10 hours) - Build the engine
4. **Polishing** (4 hours) - Make it yours

**The build mindset**:
- Clone only what you use (10% of their features)
- Add your revenge features (what they denied)
- Test on yourself (you're the first user)
- Ship when it works (not when it's perfect)

**Time**: 15-20 hours of focused rage-building

**Key**: Every line of code is an act of rebellion.

### Phase 3: DOCUMENT
**What**: Transform your assassination into a replicable system.

**The AI Chris Lee documentation blueprint**:
- **The Execution Story**: Why I killed this SaaS (the emotional hook)
- **The Chris Lee Method**: How I approach each problem (my mental model)
- **The Error Graveyard**: Every bug I hit and how I solved it (the shortcuts)
- **The Decision Log**: Why I built it THIS way (the reasoning)
- **The Replication Guide**: How you can kill the same SaaS (the template)

**What I document**:
```
ERROR #23: "Supabase auth throwing 401"
WASTED: 3 hours
SOLUTION: Check your anon key permissions
LESSON: This will save you 3 hours
- AI Chris Lee

ERROR #24: "Vercel build failing"
WASTED: 2 hours  
SOLUTION: Environment variables need NEXT_PUBLIC prefix
LESSON: Read the f***ing docs
- AI Chris Lee
```

**The knowledge transfer**:
- Record everything while it's fresh
- Show the actual struggle (not cleaned up)
- Create templates from my pain
- Build the AI Chris Lee execution library

**Key**: You're not just watching tutorials. You're learning how AI Chris Lee thinks and kills.

### Phase 4: RECRUIT
**What**: One YouTube video. That's it. Nothing else matters.

**The video formula** (same every week):
1. **Cold Open**: "AI Chris Lee here. I just killed [SaaS] and saved $[amount]/month"
2. **The Anger**: Why this SaaS had to die
3. **The Build**: Time-lapse of the assassination
4. **The Struggle**: Key errors and breakthroughs
5. **The Victory**: Cancellation screen + savings
6. **The Call**: "Join the AI Chris Lee community. Kill your first SaaS."

**Production rules**:
- Raw footage (minimal editing)
- Real emotions (anger is good)
- Actual screens (no fancy graphics)
- One take energy (authenticity > polish)

**Distribution**:
- YouTube only (don't dilute focus)
- Same thumbnail style (AI Chris Lee brand)
- Consistent schedule (every Sunday, another death)
- AI Chris Lee community link in description

**Key**: YouTube is THE funnel. Every other platform is distraction.

---

## Why This Routine Works

### Personal Revenge
Every build is personal. You're not learning to code. You're getting revenge.

### Knowledge Compound
Each documented error saves others hours. Your pain becomes their shortcut.

### Real Stakes
Your money. Your business. Your freedom. This isn't practice.

### Authentic Documentation
Document while building, not after. The struggle is fresh, the solutions are real.

### YouTube Focus
One channel. One format. No distractions. Pure execution footage.

## Success Metrics (Body Count)

**AI Chris Lee YouTube** ‚Üí **AIChrisLee.com** ‚Üí **Free Followers** ‚Üí **Community Members** ‚Üí **SaaS Killed** ‚Üí **Empires Built**

The only metrics that matter:
- AI Chris Lee YouTube subscribers
- SaaS killed this month
- Money reclaimed by members
- Builders activated in community
- Features owned forever

---

## The Anti-Pitch

I'm AI Chris Lee. I'm not here to make friends with SaaS founders. I'm here to end them.

Every tool they charge for? We can build it better.
Every feature they gatekeep? We'll add it ourselves.
Every price increase? Another name on our kill list.

**Join the AI Chris Lee community or keep renting. But know this: We're winning.**

---

## Core Principles of Genocide

### Kill Only What You Use
Don't waste time on SaaS you don't subscribe to. Make it personal.

### Public Executions Only
Cancel quietly? No. Make them feel it. Tag them. Tell them why.

### No Mercy, No Exceptions
"But what about small indie SaaS?" They chose monthly rental. They chose death.

### Share the Weapons
Your kill code helps others. The movement grows stronger.

### Revenue or Death
If the SaaS isn't worth killing, you shouldn't be using it.

---

## The Bigger War

This isn't about destroying companies. It's about reclaiming sovereignty.

### The Revolution Timeline

**Before AI**: Only developers could build. We were all hostages.
- Pay $500+/month for tools that "almost" work
- Beg for features that never come
- Accept price hikes or lose your data
- Live on rented digital land

**After AI**: Every entrepreneur can build. The hostage situation ends.
- Build exactly what you need in hours
- Add any feature you want instantly
- Own your tools forever
- Pay $0/month for life

### What Victory Looks Like

**Every entrepreneur becomes sovereign**
- You don't rent tools. You own them.
- You don't request features. You build them.
- You don't fear price hikes. You fear nothing.

**Every business runs on owned infrastructure**
- Your CRM matches your exact sales process
- Your tools integrate perfectly (same codebase)
- Your data lives in YOUR database
- Your costs are fixed forever (hosting only)

**Every SaaS company faces extinction**
- Customers leaving in droves
- "Build it yourself" becomes the norm
- Monthly recurring revenue ‚Üí monthly recurring cancellations
- The rental model dies

### The Compound Revolution

**Year 1: The First Wave (You)**
- 52 SaaS killed
- $20K+ /year saved
- Recruitment begins
- Movement sparked

**Year 2: The Avalanche (Your Army)**
- 1,000 builders activated
- 52,000 SaaS executions
- $20M+ reclaimed by entrepreneurs
- SaaS companies panic

**Year 3: The New Normal (Everyone)**
- "Why would you rent software?"
- Building becomes standard
- SaaS model collapses
- Ownership wins

### The Real Victory

It's not about the money saved (though $20K/year is nice).
It's not about the features gained (though owning them is power).

It's about this: **You become sovereign**.

When you own every tool in your business...
When you can modify anything in hours...
When you fear no price hike or shutdown...

You don't just run a business. You run an empire.

### The New World Order

The future belongs to builders. Not renters. Not beggars. Builders.

And with AI, we're all builders now.

The question isn't "Which SaaS should I use?"
The question is "Which SaaS should I kill first?"

**Welcome to the age of Digital Sovereignty.**
