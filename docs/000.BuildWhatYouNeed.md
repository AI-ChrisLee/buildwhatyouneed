# Build What You Need: Productize Yourself Using AI

> "Building a community platform is 20% vibe coding, 80% solving edge cases. Every error in this document cost hours to solve - now you can solve them in minutes."

## The Real Point

I'm not a developer. I'm just a typical online entrepreneur with a few successes under my belt. 

I'm here to share how I'm productizing myself - turning my knowledge, experience, and workflow into automated tools using AI. I build for myself first, then teach you to build for yourself.

**The revolution**: AI isn't just changing coding. It's changing who can build. Now every entrepreneur can own their tools instead of renting them.

**My challenge**: 1 week, 1 app. Not because you have to. Because it proves you can.

## Who I Am (And Why It Matters)

Built a $600K web agency in Korea. 9 employees. 40K YouTube subscribers where I shared my whole journey. 

Then I hit a wall. Couldn't find what I was looking for. So I ran away to Vancouver.

Now I'm in monk mode with AI. Locked in. Figuring out every bottleneck in my business and solving it with code I build myself.

**The mission**: Become a trillion-dollar entrepreneur. Not by raising money. By systematizing everything.

## The ROI Framework

### Real ROI Examples

**Week 1: Community Platform (Replacing Circle.so)**
- Time invested: 20 hours (including all the errors)
- Result: Own my entire community infrastructure
- Real ROI: Software I'll use for 3+ years, built in 20 hours
- Bonus: Can add any feature I need instantly

**Week 2: Customer Intelligence System**
- Time invested: 15 hours
- Manual work before: 10 hours/week analyzing customers
- Automated work now: 30 minutes
- Real ROI: 9.5 hours/week back in my life

**Week 3: Content Distribution Engine**
- Time invested: 12 hours
- Before: 2 hours daily posting everywhere
- After: 5 minutes
- Real ROI: 1.5 hours/day = 45 hours/month saved

**The pattern**: Each tool I build works for years. Each hour invested pays back 100x.

## What This Community Really Is

### Not a Coding School
I'm not a teacher. I'm just sharing my journey as I build.

When I hit Error #23? I document it.
When something takes 6 hours instead of 2? I show why.
When it finally works? We all learn together.

**"The best teachers don't just show the code - they share the struggle, the errors, and the breakthroughs."**

### A Build Journal with Benefits
- **Watch me build**: One tool per week, every error included
- **Get the blueprints**: Every line of code, every decision documented
- **Skip my mistakes**: Why spend 6 hours on Error #23 when I already solved it?
- **Build alongside**: Your business, your tools, but my documented shortcuts

### What Makes This Different
We don't need tutorials anymore. The best way to learn? Ask Claude: "How do I fix this?"

So I'm not teaching you to code. I'm showing you:
- How to identify what to build
- How to explain it to AI effectively
- How to debug when things break
- How to turn your unique business needs into working software

## The Systematic Approach

### My Build Process (What You'll See Each Week)

**1. Identify the Bottleneck**
Start by cloning what you already use. Then customize it to work YOUR way.

**2. Foundation & PRD**
What exactly are we building? Why? For whom?

**3. UI Wireframe**
Sketch it out. Ugly is fine. Function > form.

**4. Database Design**
What data do we need? Keep it simple.

**5. Backend Development**
APIs, authentication, the boring stuff that makes it work.

**6. Polishing**
Make it feel good to use. Add the touches that matter.

**7. Analyze**
What worked? What didn't? What would I do differently?

## My War Routine: Build - Educate - Share - Analyze

This is my non-negotiable process. Four phases, every project, no exceptions.

### Phase 1: BUILD
**What**: Pick ONE bottleneck in my business and build a tool to eliminate it.

**The process**:
- Identify the problem (usually something that annoyed me last week)
- Clone existing solution (Circle.so, Calendly, whatever I'm replacing)
- Customize it to work MY way
- Debug until it actually works
- Polish until I'm proud to use it

**Time**: However long it takes (usually 15-20 hours with all the errors)

**Key**: I build for ME first. If it doesn't solve MY problem, I don't build it.

### Phase 2: EDUCATE
**What**: Transform my chaotic build process into structured learning.

**The process**:
- Document every error I hit and how I solved it
- Create step-by-step course content
- Prepare templates and code snippets
- Record the "behind the scenes" story

**The framework**:
- Show the problem (why I built this)
- Show the errors (what went wrong)
- Show the solutions (how I fixed it)
- Show the final code (what actually works)

**Key**: I'm not teaching theory. I'm showing exactly what I did, errors and all.

### Phase 3: SHARE
**What**: Record and publish my YouTube video.

**The exact format** (every single video):
1. **Hook**: "I was spending X hours on [problem]"
2. **Problem**: Show the painful manual process
3. **Solution attempt**: Live coding with errors
4. **Reality**: What actually happened vs. what I expected
5. **Result**: The working tool in action
6. **CTA**: "Get the code in the community"

**Production**: Minimal editing - raw is real

**Key**: Same format every time. People know exactly what to expect.

### Phase 4: ANALYZE
**What**: Figure out what worked and what's next.

**What I analyze**:
- How many hours did the build actually take?
- Which errors took the longest to solve?
- What would I do differently?
- What bottleneck should I tackle next?

**Community feedback**:
- What errors did members hit?
- What features do they want to add?
- What similar problems do they have?

**Planning next build**:
- Choose next bottleneck based on MY needs + community feedback
- Pre-research any new tech I'll need
- Document lessons learned

**Key**: Every build makes the next one easier. Document everything.

## Why This Routine Works

### Consistency
Same process every week. No decisions to make. Just execute.

### Compound Learning
Each week's errors become next week's shortcuts. By week 10, I'm 3x faster.

### Real Problems
I only build what I need RIGHT NOW. No hypothetical features.

### Authentic Education
I educate from fresh experience, not from memory. The struggles are real because they just happened.

### Sustainable Pace
One build per week is aggressive but doable. More would burn out. Less would lose momentum.

## Success Metrics (Stupid Simple)

**YouTube** → Landing Page → Free Member → Paid Member → Recurring Revenue

That's it. Every number that matters fits on one line.

- YouTube views → How many visit the site?
- Site visitors → How many join free?
- Free members → How many upgrade?
- Paid members → How many stay?

## The Anti-Pitch

Look, I'm not a teacher. I'm just an entrepreneur who documents everything.

But here's what I do: I share my workflow step by step. Every click. Every error. Every "why the hell isn't this working?" moment.

We don't need tutorials anymore. The best way to learn? Ask Claude: "How to fix this?"

So I'm not selling you a coding course. I'm sharing my actual workflow - the exact steps I take to build tools for MY business. You watch, you learn, you build your own.

**My pitch is simple**: I build SaaS for myself. I document every step. You follow along and build for yourself.

## Core Principles

### Build Only What You Need
No feature bloat. No "nice to have." If you're not using it this week, don't build it.

### Clone First, Customize Second
Start with what exists. Make it yours. Don't reinvent the wheel.

### Show Everything
The bugs, the frustrations, the moments where it doesn't work. Truth builds trust.

### Own Your Stack
Every tool you build is yours forever. No subscriptions. No limits. No asking permission.

### ROI or Die
If it doesn't save time or make money, don't build it. We're entrepreneurs, not hobbyists.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't about destroying SaaS companies. It's about democratizing software.

### The Revolution Is Here

**Before AI**: Only developers could build software. Entrepreneurs had two choices:
1. Pay $500/month for tools that "almost" work
2. Hire developers who don't understand your business

**After AI**: Every entrepreneur can build exactly what they need. No compromises. No monthly fees. No waiting for features.

### What This Really Means

**Every entrepreneur becomes their own CTO**
- You don't manage developers. You manage AI.
- You don't wait for sprints. You build in hours.
- You don't explain your vision. You build it.

**Every business owns its tools**
- Your CRM works exactly how you sell
- Your analytics track what YOU care about
- Your workflows match YOUR process
- Everything integrates because you built it

**Every bottleneck becomes an opportunity**
- See a problem? Build the solution.
- Hate a process? Automate it.
- Need a feature? Add it today.

### The Compound Effect

**Year 1: Foundation (52 tools)**
- Replace your entire SaaS stack
- Learn what you actually need
- Build confidence with every tool
- Save $20K+ in subscriptions

**Year 2: Acceleration (Building faster, thinking bigger)**
- Each tool takes half the time
- Start connecting tools together
- Build more complex systems
- Your business runs itself

**Year 3: Mastery (You can build anything)**
- See problem → Build solution same day
- Your entire business is systematized
- You think in systems, not tasks
- Nothing can stop you

### The Real Transformation

It's not about the money saved (though that's nice).
It's not about the features gained (though they matter).

It's about this: **You become unstoppable**.

When every tool works exactly how you think...
When every process flows exactly how you designed...
When every bottleneck becomes a building opportunity...

You don't just run a business. You conduct a symphony.

### The New Entrepreneur

The future belongs to builders. Not managers. Not coordinators. Builders.

And with AI, we can all be builders now.

The question isn't "How much will this SaaS cost?"
The question is "How fast can I build this myself?"

**Welcome to the age of the Builder-Entrepreneur.**
